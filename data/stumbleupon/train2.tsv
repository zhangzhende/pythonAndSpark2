holographic calls, air-breathing batteries"",""body"":""A sign stands outside the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg Buildings stand at the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in the Santa Teresa Hills of San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg By 2015 your mobile phone will project a 3 D image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy At least that s what International Business Machines Corp sees in its crystal ball The predictions are part of an annual tradition for the Armonk New York based company which surveys its 3 000 researchers to find five ideas expected to take root in the next five years IBM the world s largest provider of computer services looks to Silicon Valley for input gleaning many ideas from its Almaden research center in San Jose California Holographic conversations projected from mobile phones lead this year s list The predictions also include air breathing batteries computer programs that can tell when and where traffic jams will take place environmental information generated by sensors in cars and phones and cities powered by the heat thrown off by computer servers These are all stretch goals and that s good said Paul Saffo managing director of foresight at the investment advisory firm Discern in San Francisco In an era when pessimism is the new black a little dose of technological optimism is not a bad thing For IBM it s not just idle speculation The company is one of the few big corporations investing in long range research projects and it counts on innovation to fuel growth Saffo said Not all of its predictions pan out though IBM was overly optimistic about the spread of speech technology for instance When the ideas do lead to products they can have broad implications for society as well as IBM s bottom line he said Research Spending They have continued to do research when all the other grand research organizations are gone said Saffo who is also a consulting associate professor at Stanford University IBM invested 5 8 billion in research and development last year 6 1 percent of revenue While that s down from about 10 percent in the early 1990s the company spends a bigger share on research than its computing rivals Hewlett Packard Co the top maker of personal computers spent 2 4 percent last year At Almaden scientists work on projects that don t always fit in with IBM s computer business The lab s research includes efforts to develop an electric car battery that runs 500 miles on one charge a filtration system for desalination and a program that shows changes in geographic data IBM rose 9 cents to 146 04 at 11 02 a m in New York Stock Exchange composite trading The stock had gained 11 percent this year before today Citizen Science The list is meant to give a window into the company s innovation engine said Josephine Cheng a vice president at IBM s Almaden lab All this demonstrates a real culture of innovation at IBM and willingness to devote itself to solving some of the world s biggest problems she said Many of the predictions are based on projects that IBM has in the works One of this year s ideas that sensors in cars wallets and personal devices will give scientists better data about the environment is an expansion of the company s citizen science initiative Earlier this year IBM teamed up with the California State Water Resources Control Board and the City of San Jose Environmental Services to help gather information about waterways Researchers from Almaden created an application that lets smartphone users snap photos of streams and creeks and report back on conditions The hope is that these casual observations will help local and state officials who don t have the resources to do the work themselves Traffic Predictors IBM also sees data helping shorten commutes in the next five years Computer programs will use algorithms and real time traffic information to predict which roads will have backups and how to avoid getting stuck Batteries may last 10 times longer in 2015 than today IBM says Rather than using the current lithium ion technology new models could rely on energy dense metals that only need to interact with the air to recharge Some electronic devices might ditch batteries altogether and use something similar to kinetic wristwatches which only need to be shaken to generate a charge The final prediction involves recycling the heat generated by computers and data centers Almost half of the power used by data centers is currently spent keeping the computers cool IBM scientists say it would be better to harness that heat to warm houses and offices In IBM s first list of predictions compiled at the end of 2006 researchers said instantaneous speech translation would become the norm That hasn t happened yet While some programs can quickly translate electronic documents and instant messages and other apps can perform limited speech translation there s nothing widely available that acts like the universal translator in Star Trek Second Life The company also predicted that online immersive environments such as Second Life would become more widespread While immersive video games are as popular as ever Second Life s growth has slowed Internet users are flocking instead to the more 2 D environments of Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc Meanwhile a 2007 prediction that mobile phones will act as a wallet ticket broker concierge bank and shopping assistant is coming true thanks to the explosion of smartphone applications Consumers can pay bills through their banking apps buy movie tickets and get instant feedback on potential purchases all with a few taps on their phones The nice thing about the list is that it provokes thought Saffo said If everything came true they wouldn t be doing their job To contact the reporter on this story Ryan Flinn in San Francisco at rflinn bloomberg net To contact the editor responsible for this story Tom Giles at tgiles5 bloomberg net by 2015, your mobile phone will project a 3-d image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy. at least that\u2019s what international business machines corp. sees in its crystal ball."",""url"":""bloomberg news 2010 12 23 ibm predicts

Spurs Throwback Jersey From 1967 to 1973 the Dallas Chaparrals were easily the most stunning pack of ballers in the ABA And then they moved to San Antonio long before the Spurs decided to pay

Barrette on an Ottawa Senators message board 7 Chicago White Sox Throwback Jersey Dick Allen s hipster glasses and epic stare hog this intense moment but we re still intrigued by the powder blue button down The Ambrose Burnside sideburns complete this masterful shot 6 Los Angeles Lakers Throwback Jersey The Minneapolis Lakers would only last 13 years 1947 1960 but they certainly cemented

"http://www.naffziger.net/blog/2008/07/05/the-alton-brown-flower-pot-smoker/"	"3294"	"{""title"":""The Alton Brown Flower Pot Smoker "",""body"":""Friends built the Alton Brown flower pot smoker a few months back and then visited this weekend and convinced me to build one for the Fourth Getting the parts While the actual construction of the smoker is trivial I found that gathering all of the needed items was challenging Many of the items were hard to source If you live in Seattle the guide below should help tremendously Generally speaking I would recommend that you try ordering everything but the Pot Bowl and bricks online Pot size selection The two hardest to source parts drive pot size selection The terra cotta bowl is hard to find The 17 bowl is the largest I was able to find anywhere It is also really heavy so it is impractical to order online However if you can find an 18 bowl I would be pretty tempted to get an 18 pot You can definitely fit the Weber 22 5 replacement charcoal grate in the pot it is actually about 17 or possibly even the 18 5 grill grate it is slightly less than 18 in actual diameter Not only would you get more cooking surface but you d also have a much easier to source grate Parts List ItemPriceSourceComments17 Terra Cotta Pot 19Home DepotThey had these at City Peoples but I didn t stop there until later 17 Terra Cotta Bowl 22City Peoples Garden StoreHard to find Try garden nursery stores I think it is also called an azalea bowl Some people use saucers that they drill into Heat Element 10Walgreens AmazonThere are reports of insufficiently sized heat elements This is a 1000W element that others have had success with The Maxi Matic ESB 300X is nearly identical to the Walgreens element I originally used The interior wires are a little shorter and thinner but otherwise the construction is nearly identical 16 Grill grate 20Sutter Hearth Home in BallardThe standard Weber sizes 14 18 and 22 are available everywhere Unfortunately they don t fit Order a 16 grate online well in advance I ended up using a more expensive grill topper Grill Thermometer 14Sutter Home HearthShockingly hard to find Try ordering online Pan for wood chips unkour kitchenShould be easy to find Get as heavy a pan as possible Ceramic Pot feet 6Stoneway HardwareThese are pretty easy to find elsewhere 3 Bricks 1 50Home DepotCould be 2 4s or anything else to get the smoker above the base 5 lb Pecan Wood Chunks 15Sutter Hearth HomePlan ahead and consider ordering online I later found Apple and Cherry chunks at Stoneway hardware for much less We used about 2 3 of the wood Getting the Heat Element controls out of the smoker I wanted to get the controls for the heat element outside of the smoker so that I could adjust the heat without opening the smoker This approach had the added advantage of getting the plastic base and overheat sensor out of the hot pot This was shockingly easy to do These instructions are for the Walgreens hot plate which seems to be pretty commonly used I m assuming that you re smart enough not to plug in the hot plate Remove the screw that connects the burner to the plastic base There is just one screw and its in the middle of the burner at the top Disconnect the wires from the heat element They are meant to be easily disconnected and reconnected All you need to do is press the tab and pull the wire and connector off of the pin Place some foil or preferably a non conductor over the exposed base to catch any drippings that may fall out of the pot we had none escape Keep the foil clear of the control element Center the hot plate base amongst the bricks see photo and run the wires up the hole in the bottom Reconnect them to the heat element I don t think it matters but the fat wire was originally connected to the prong that runs to the center of the heat element I used both bricks and the pot holder feet so that I could raise the smoker up off the base plate and allow air to flow up through the hole in the pot I then placed a brick in bottom of the smoker to support the heat element and keep the electrical prongs off the base of the pot I had to chip the corners of the brick so that it could sit to the side of the hole for air flow Obviously the wiring is much more exposed than it was in the sealed hot plate It is actually very hard to touch the wires during operation but be careful Also I d highly recommend you ensure that you re plugged into a GFCI protected outlet all outdoor outlets in buildings built after the mid eighties are required to be GFCI protected Temperature management and monitoring The temp at the top of the grill does a good job telling the temp inside the smoker We kept wireless temp probes in the meat throughout the process Metal smokers vs the Flower Pot vs the Big Green Egg You can buy a metal smoker from Wal mart or other sources for less than you ll spend assembling the flower pot smoker I ve never cooked with a metallic smoker but based on other comments I ve read the inexpensive ones are thin and shed heat tremendously quickly When we were finished smoking the internal temp was about 210 Two hours later it was 140 Four hours later it was still warm to the touch The Terra Cotta simply holds the heat really well The ambient air was in the sixties with a strong wind on our roof deck However the flower pot is no match for the Big Green Eggs These ceramic smokers are massive The equivalent size to the flower pot is probably the Large Egg which has an 18 diameter cooking area weighs 140 lbs and retails for 700 Plus I can t imagine I d have had as much fun as I did figuring the flower pot smoker out Recipe We cooked two 4 5lb Boston Butts on the 4th using Alton Brown s recipe for the brine and rub It turned out fantastically well Enjoy UpdateHamilton posted a series of really good questions alongside one of the photos and I wanted to include the questions and my responses here as I think they ll help other people I was wondering if you think it would be feasible to run a second Walgreen s burner through that bottom hole and into the pot This may give me the potential for more heat and heat control in the winter months when the weather is a little cooler here in South Carolina Maybe stagger them in the pot one above the other Or even side by side standing up I don t think you ll need to do this We had trouble keeping the heat down in the target 220 range and never had the dial anywhere near the halfway point By the end of the session I don t think the dial would go any lower Also these are 1000W burners 9 Amps Many household circuits are 15 Amps some are 20 so you d run the risk of blowing a fuse if you plugged them into the same circuit However if you did do it I don t think you d want to stagger them as the heat from the lower one may melt the solder on the higher one Side by side would work but you d need something else to set the grate on Also when you disconnect the burner from the base do you have enough length in the wire to connect the burner back to the burner once you ve run it through the hole with the original connections or do I need to buy some extension wires It is tight but there is enough wire If you do need to get wire make sure it is thermally insulated What was the highest temp you were able to see in your cooker We accidentally let it rise to around 240 220 is the target At some point I ll do a controlled test but it could definitely go much higher Do you soak your wood chips as well as leave water in the bottom of the pan When do you like to put the chips in the cooker When the cooker comes up to temp We used chunks instead of chips as they are less likely to actually catch fire I ve read that you don t need to soak them but a friend advised to soak half This way the dry ones start smoking early and the wet ones start smoking later So you don t need to lift the top until later in the cooking process lifting the top lets out the smoke and cools everything slightly Do you end up adding more chips to the pan throughout the cooking process If so what is your advice for removing the grill surface and the meat We added wood once and only opened the top twice The second time we lifted the top was to rotate the butts The meat can be easily removed using foil and oven mitts We had a plate with foil on the side to set them on If you look carefully at the picture of the butts you ll see two screws sticking up through the cooking surface We gripped the screws with oven mitts and lifted it directly out it did take a bit of effort as it was kind of jammed down there To remove the upper pot lid have you come up with a good handle or do you have an alternative method As your graph shows I guess it s a little hot and awkward to fooling around with when it s that hot It shockingly isn t too hot to touch The lid measurements are from the interior The exterior of the terra cotta is definitely cooler Some people claim that they can use their bare hands I just used oven mitts but used my hands to make minor adjustments Would it be beneficial to drill more holes in the bottom of the pot to let in more fresh air or do you think that would let too much heat out I don t think you want to do this You don t want the wood to burn heavy air flow you want it to combust enough to smoke We had absolutely no problems with air flow "",""url"":""naffziger

bacteria in teen acne battle"",""title"":""Doctors Strike Mutating Bacteria In Teen Acne Battle Shots doctors strike mutating bacteria in teen acne battle : npr"",""body"":""Charles Bowman University of Pittsburgh A tiny bacteriophage virus can cripple the bacteria that cause troublesome acne on teens skin Acne the scourge of many an adolescent life is getting harder to treat but 80 percent of teenagers have some form of it Conventional treatment includes topical and oral antibiotics Studies are now finding the bacteria that cause acne are increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment Alternatively there are effective laser treatments But these are costly and typically not covered by insurance Now researchers are scrambling to come up with new treatments for acne One promising possibility involves harnessing a harmless virus living on skin that naturally seeks out and kills the bacteria that cause pimples People Always Notice It s every teenager s nightmare big blistery red bumps on their faces That s what people notice first about you so no matter how great of a person you are no matter how pretty your eyes are how nice your smile is people always notice the blemishes on your face says Rohini Bagrodia a really pretty 22 year old with beautiful eyes a great smile and a history of battling acne In school it meant avoiding the spotlight I would always shy away from those opportunities that would bring all the focus on me Bagrodia says She wouldn t take part in class discussions She wouldn t raise her hand And it s all because of a tiny bacteria that lives on the skin UCLA dermatologist Dr Jenny Kim says many people don t realize it s bacteria that cause acne Some people say your face is dirty you need to clean it more scrub more don t eat chocolate things like that But really it s caused by bacteria and the oil inside the pore allows the bacteria to overpopulate Kim says For most teenagers with mild acne over the counter products containing peroxide or salicylic acid are enough to clear up the acne But lots of teenagers end up in the doctor s office and getting antibiotics This was the hardest thing for Bagrodia No matter how much she followed doctors orders diligently cleaning her face and using antibiotic cream nothing worked Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Dermatologist Elizabeth Martin is in private practice in Birmingham Ala and is a fellow with the American Academy of Dermatology She says these bacteria like many others are mutating quickly and becoming resistant to antibiotics Over the years we have seen an increase in this antibiotic resistant bacterium both in the U S and also worldwide Martin says She points to studies that show a tripling of drug resistant acne bacteria over the past few decades This means doctors can no longer rely on antibiotics alone Most doctors now use a combination of low dose antibiotics along with benzoyl peroxide which also kills acne causing bacteria As Martin says benzoyl peroxide works to decrease bacteria through a different mechanism than antibiotics and it helps to prevent development of resistant bacteria When we combine benzoyl peroxide along with an antibiotic patients tend to have better clearance of their acne than when we use antibiotics alone Other Treatment Options Retinoids vitamin A derivatives can also be used early on to treat acne Typically creams they work by unclogging pores before they become large inflamed bumps A stronger form called Accutane is used for severe acne It s a highly effective pill but it can cause serious side effects including depression and birth defects So the government regulates its use Intensely focused light and lasers can also help fight acne when other treatments fail Kim is also a researcher at UCLA In the room dedicated to light and laser therapy Kim points out what appears to be a half cylinder with stacks of oblong light bulbs Patients with acne can go right under blue light and they sit there for about 15 20 minutes and acne often improves after several treatments Kim says It s not known exactly how light therapy works to fight acne but Kim says studies indicate it destroys the bacteria Probably physically without giving it time to mutate and the other thing the light treatment can improve the inflammation that the bacteria causes in acne she says But laser and light therapy doesn t work for everyone It s expensive and typically not covered by insurance So Kim and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh are also looking into an entirely new way to fight acne taking a harmless virus that lives on the skin and programming it to become a bacteria killer The virus is going to go and kill the bacteria that causes acne It s just going to break it apart and burst its membrane so there s no time for the bacteria to mutate she says It s sort of a surprise attack The approach is a promising way to get rid of acne without using antibiotics If further lab studies prove successful researchers will begin testing on people to see if viral therapy is both safe and effective in fighting acne as acne bacteria develop resistance to antibiotic treatments, doctors turn to zit-fighting viruses. as acne bacteria develop resistance to antibiotic treatments, doctors turn to zit-fighting

of their money must be the sale of bottled water In the western world tap water is about as safe as it can be and it is relatively cheap Yet many people are prepared to pay up to 1 500 times as much when the same stuff comes in a bottle In this paper we will consider this phenomenon The bottled water boom was indeed an unlikely phenomenon Perhaps the strangest thing about it was that this bland commodity made its impact in Britain at the height of a recession and with raging inflation There was a general lack of money in people s pockets yet bottled water became an overnight success Strange too is the fact that present water companies boast of the purity of their product when the various impurities that mineral waters contain used to be the whole point of buying the stuff anyway Natural water is never purer than when it falls on the hills as rain Once it hits the ground however all that changes Seeping into the soil it moves underground through passages and caverns carved over the millennia eating away at the rock and dissolving metals salts and minerals along the way As it goes its character changes depending on the type of rock through which it passes Eventually it arrives in underground lakes or aquifers the sources of most bottled mineral waters Throw out the Bath water Since Roman times Bath Spa in Britain has been a centre renowned for its mineral springs and baths Little has changed since Roman times Bath spring waters have always had a reputation for health giving properties because of their natural origins But merely because they are natural and come from underground does not mean that they are safe to drink A study carried out by the University of Wales found elevated amounts of several elements regarded as poisonous in the water Bath s waters come up from some 22 miles below the surface On their way they absorb quantities of fluoride and sulphates well beyond the safety limits set for tap water It s the water which is good for you it is usually better to keep the minerals out The minerals can often do harm Over the past half century there has been a distinct shift of opinion Until the Second World War the waters of Bath were advertised and promoted on the amount of radioactivity they contained People believed that radioactivity was health promoting They don t believe that now and the radioactivity of Bath s spring water isn t mentioned today Travelling through the ground as it does Bath s water picks up more than minerals In 1979 a girl swimming in a pool dived down to where the source water was coming in and swallowed some of it Five days later she died of amoebic meningitis Tests showed that the amoeba was in the water and the pool was closed The fad in the bottle By the 1970s people had stopped taking the waters the fashion had faded and the days of health giving spring waters appeared to be over But an advertising campaign by the French company Perrier in 1974 was to bring about a dramatic change The Financial Times in an article on the Mineral and Spring waters market called the campaign a waste of time because bottled waters it said would be drunk only by cranks and foreigners How wrong they were Bottled water has become an extraordinary success story Sales of bottled water totalled 3 million litres in 1976 In just one decade that figure rose to 128 million litres and by 1991 some 300 million bottles of mineral water were drunk in Britain alone Wenche Marshall Foster Chairman and Chief Executive of Perrier UK predicts that the market will rise to one billion litres a year by the turn of the century A survey of 250 people from London and the Midlands published in 1992 found that a quarter of them never drank water directly from the tap Perrier has been joined by many other companies eager to cash in on the trend There are now 113 producers of bottled water in Britain from large hi tech bottling factories to small unsophisticated ones in garden sheds All are attempting to cash in on the 1 million a day UK market But the market is still dominated by the big names and supermarkets own brands Perrier owns Buxton Water Contrex Volvic Vichy Saint Yorre and others Scotland s Highland Spring which is owned by a consortium registered in Liechtenstein bottles for Tesco Sainsbury s and the Co op The image Whatever the brand name the image they project is the same cleanliness purity and health To sell a commodity at a high price to people who can get it for next to nothing out of the tap the image is all important and not always realistic Buxton Water is advertised on television and the bottle with pictures of the beautiful Derbyshire landscape The water is bottled in an industrial estate next to a busy railway yard Glyndwr Spring Water on the other hand is bottled by hand in a portacabin in a field Where they are bottled does not mean that they are necessarily contaminated but neither does it mean that they are necessarily safe to drink What is important is what is happening on the catchment area from which the water is taken Water is water What gives the different bottled waters their particular characteristics is the minerals and chemicals that they pick up in their passage through the ground and they will pick up any and all Most of the water is taken from a rural environment This means that to be safe to drink what happens on the earth through which they flow must be strictly controlled For example cattle and other animals excrete waste material Ground around springs should not be used for grazing Over large areas there should be no pesticides or herbicides used Do these areas get the degree of control they need Nobody knows there is no information Although all bottled waters are believed to be from natural springs some are not Some are from the same surface water sources as the local tap water and some are tap water Marwin UK Ltd based in a Manchester industrial estate markets a bottled water called Purefect 95 This comes straight out of a tap from the Manchester main water supply and is then purified further by the company Purefect 95 is not spring water but it is probably one of the cleanest and purest bottled waters on the market because the company s purification is in addition to all the checks cleaning and treating that the regulations demand of its public supply source Purefect 95 s label proclaims Purefect 95 is produced here in Manchester from upland water sources utilising the latest treatment techniques It is purified by a series of specialised processes which remove unwanted or potentially harmful chemicals giving you a wholesome water for all your drinking and culinary requirements With no minerals no organic or inorganic chemicals and no bacteria in it Marwin can claim with justification that it is the best bottled water you can buy Purefect 95 is not the only bottled tap water In the South Crystal Spring is bottled from London s tap water and the soft drinks giant Schweppes is planning to bottle tap water in Britain just as Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola already do in the USA The BBC1 consumer programme Watchdog looked at Designer Waters on 27 September 1996 The programme concentrated on Crystal Spring which is made in the basement of a London restaurant and which sells for 2 a bottle in around two hundred other restaurants They found that the only differences between Crystal Spring and the London tap water from which it is made were slightly raised levels of copper and zinc and because the chlorine had been removed bacteria levels 10 000 times higher Crystal Spring may still be safe to drink despite these high levels but it cannot be as safe as the original tap water A great book that shatters so many of the nutritional fantasies and fads of the last twenty years Read it and prolong your life

the most famous of Levi Strauss s inventions followed closely by jeans shorts and jeans jackets blue jeans have been an American staple for over 140 years Originally developed as work clothes for miners and cowboys jeans have since gone from durable mess clothes to a trendy fashion statement While a pair of Lev s today will run you about 60 there are many other jeans companies that are much less focused on value and much more focused on making a statement The following are just a few of the most expensive jeans known to man For All Mankind AVERAGE PRICE 150 300 Coming in appropriately at number 7 7 For All Mankind jeans are impressively expensive pants A fashion symbol for young kids with money to burn a pair of these jeans will run anywhere from 150 to 300 per pair Although 7 is a status brand that doesn t need to offer things like sales or reasonably priced goods they do offer free shipping on all orders over 150 This is incredibly nice of them considering denim only costs 5 per yard Picking up the tab on shipping cuts significantly into their 700 mark up but that s okay they are a brand for all mankind so they are glad to do it Roberto Cavalli AVERAGE PRICE 700 1 200 One of the newer brands rocking the American classic is from Italy Roberto Cavalli has caught the attention of J Lo as well as numerous other Hollywood fashionistas so you know they re pricey Ranging from 700 and 1200 Roberto Cavalli jeans have such luxury features as belt loops and 5 pockets seriously they are bragging about these things Other features not mentioned on the website but are included with every purchase include the fact that they are blue they are pants and people can wear them Made from the exotic cotton plant these denim bottoms will make you look like you re the tops Gucci AVERAGE PRICE 600 3 100 Though most normal Gucci jeans retail for a somewhat reasonable 600 there was one pair made in 1998 that sold for 3 100 The Gucci Genius Jeans named after the people who refused to buy them featured a hand stitched floral pattern that looks like a combination between a pair of clown pants and a child s quilt By adorning a pair of already overpriced jeans with incredibly over priced flower pieces Gucci was able to make an already ridiculous item even more ridiculous Though these jeans are not available over the counter there are many individuals who will sew whatever you want onto your jeans for a nominal fee APO AVERAGE PRICE 1 000 4 000 APO has one goal in mind to make a custom fit jeans tailored to you and only you Can anyone really put a price on such luxury Yes APO can That price is between 1 and 4 thousand dollars per pair The main difference in price appears to be caused by the type of rivets and buttons available Custom shoppers will have to make a choice between 14k gold platinum or diamond hardware to accompany their navy blue loin cloths While it may seem ridiculous to put such lavish jewelry on pants the reality is this more people check out your butt than your neck or wrist so you might as well accent it with some bling Key Closet AVERAGE PRICE 10 000 If Lady Gaga is into them you know they must be good good being Latin for stupidly expensive Although it is mind boggling to think that there are people in this world who would spend more money on pants than most people do on cars Key Closet makes that improbability a reality Featuring the always classy combination of a tiger and a dragon Key Closet offers a pair of diamond and Swarovski crystal studded pants for men You know men The same individuals who dug holes and blew up mountains wearing jeans a century ago The same individuals who are rolling in their graves at the thought of the things they were mining being permanently fixed to the crappy pants they wore while mining for them Yeah those guys They have diamond pants now Dussault AVERAGE PRICE 250 000 When the family jewels are used to cover the family jewels the resulting product is overwhelmingly expensive How expensive Dussault Apparel Ss line of Trashed Denim jeans will run you a cool 250 000 Made from 249 990 worth of gold diamonds and 10 worth of thrift store jeans the Trashed Denim line makes Sthe homeless look incredibly glamorous Looking faded stressed dirty and old these jeans rely on their bling value to make them worth anything more than 2 at a garage sale Although wearing them could be a powerful status statement you may be better off melting them down pawning the diamonds and using what s left as a car towel Secret Circus AVERAGE PRICE 1 3 Million Perhaps the most unassuming of the expensive jeans this pair of denim bottoms features a simple and elegant diamond studded patch on the rear right pocket The price tag 1 3 million dollars Due to the size color and clarity of the diamonds that elegant patch is actually a ridiculous display of perfection The question remains what better way to display the 15 most brilliant diamonds ever mined than on the ass of a woman s pair of pants Although this looks radiant sitting in these jeans can actually be quite painful Conclusion Although the jeans continues to become more and more expensive the basic design hasn t changed in over a century Still the workhorse of the American wardrobe blue jeans are everyone s favorite clothing item which may explain why some people are so anxious to adorn it with jewelry Whether you are a member of Hollywood s A list or just a regular shmoe who likes feeling comfortable nothing beats a good pair of jeans baur 0,00 euro versand + gratis geschenk bei erstem einkauf! der

a challenge We need to continually push ourselves outside our comfort zone to grow and stay sharp It is easy to become lazy and complacent However our brain and our body are a use it or lose it proposition Don t waste your potential We need to find ways to challenge ourselves with new activities and learning opportunities to live life to the fullest If you have something that makes you uneasy then face it head on Push yourself outside your comfort zone and you will beat all your fears Don t grow old gracefully Fight it every step of the way by seeking new ways to stretch yourself Here are some ideas to help get you started 1 Travel to a foreign country Take out a map and find a place you ve never been Plan a trip to a country that is unfamiliar to you It will stimulate your mind and your senses You will have the opportunity to pick up parts of a new language eat different foods and meet interesting people 2 Participate in a yoga class Yoga will stretch you very literally There are numerous benefits to yoga It will help you mentally physically and some say even spiritually It certainly will help you to relieve stress and become more physically fit If you are looking for ways to keep your body toned then a yoga class may be a good choice 3 Go on a solo backpacking trip There is something very stimulating about camping alone in the woods You are totally dependent on your own wits and skill A trip like this pits you against nature for comfort and sometimes survival The solitude will also give you time alone with your thoughts 4 Arrange a public speaking engagement Apparently speaking in public is a fear greater than death for some people This is one fear that everyone can conquer Why let something simple shackle you The key is to just do it Your local Toastmasters club would be happy to help 5 Audition for a role in a play Give your creative side a chance to come alive in the theater Were you in a high school production Why not give it a try again You might rediscover something about yourself that has been suppressed 6 Read a book with an opposing view We can all get set in our ways and our limited view of the world Pick up a book at your local library that purports a view that is contrary to one that you hold dear Read it from cover to cover and try to keep an open mind Note points that make some sense and ponder them 7 Change jobs I run into people all the time that seem to hate their jobs but they won t go out and find a better one Don t stay stuck in a rut any longer Take a step today toward finding a new position After all if you aren t happy now what do you have to lose 8 Volunteer to improve your community Volunteer opportunities abound These needs give us the chance to expose ourselves to things we won t normally see in our safe little lives It will expand our horizons and give us a greater appreciation for what we have In addition you might just make a difference in someone else s life along the way 9 Learn to scuba dive Find your local PADI certified training center and learn to be an Open Water Diver I was fortunate enough to do this myself recently It is a lot of fun and a bit of a challenge You will feel like a true explorer once you are certified 10 Dress up for Halloween Get yourself a costume and find yourself a Halloween party Express your inner child by dressing up and having some fun My wife and I did this last year and it was a complete hoot I highly recommend it as a way to bring yourself out of a shell 11 Take a dance class Dancing is great exercise a fun way to meet people and a fantastic way to creatively express yourself There are all kinds of dance classes that you can find to meet your individual tastes You might even meet a new friend in the process 12 Enroll in a college course Is it time to expand your knowledge in a particular area Maybe you need a way to spark new interest in a subject that has always intrigued you College courses are a great way to give yourself a new challenge while also expanding your opportunities 13 Introduce yourself to a complete stranger For some this is no big deal but for others of us this is not something that comes easily Set a goal to meet five new people this week What s the worst that can happen You might make a connection that will blossom into a fruitful relationship 14 Attend a service at the church of your choice Are you attending to your spiritual needs If not maybe it is time for you to seek out a place of worship Not sure where to go I would suggest asking a friend if you can accompany them It will make their day 15 Sit alone in complete silence for an hour This one sounds simple enough but give it a try It is harder than you think We are so accustomed to noise and to being in the presence of others that you might initially find this very challenging My guess is that if you do it for a few days that it will become something you love 16 Move to a new home Find a new place to live in a different city or at least on the other side of town A move will force you out of your ruts You will have to develop new routines and explore a new area This will give you a chance to grow and expand your boundaries 17 Go on an eco adventure Travel to Belize Costa Rica or another location that offers eco adventures The world is a big place and nature is full of fascinating creatures Get out there and see something new A trip like this is dangerous because it could change your entire life 18 Fly down a zip line Taking a zip line tour is a rush It will definitely get your adrenaline flowing I did this when I went to Puerto Vallarta Mexico earlier this year The zip line was total fun This type of thrill seeking awakens your adventurous spirit 19 Organize a reunion Reach out to some people that you haven t seen in awhile This could be family classmates or just an old friend that you haven t talked to in years Reminiscing about the past might stir up old ideas in you that you forgot you had 20 Write something and get it published Writing is a terrific way to express yourself and tap into your creativity Getting what you write published will give you a sense of accomplishment You will also probably get quite a nice boost from the positive reviews that you ll receive There is no excuse for remaining in your present rut A new challenge will energize you and give you the courage to continue to grow We only have one life to live and you do not want to waste another day Go stretch yourself outside your comfort zone What other ways are there to get out of our comfort zones Photo by stephcarter Related

the Royal Society of Chemistry wanted to find the perfect gravy recipe as part of their 2009 Year of Food project they went to Yorkshireman and chemist John Emsley He uses all the elements of a traditional roast to make his gravy from the meat juices to the water the vegetables are boiled in which add nutrients as well as flavour The perfect way to do the Sunday meal is with gravy from the joint Why waste the nutrients he says Start by cooking the joint on a bed of halved onions carrots and celery which juices from the meat will slowly trickle on to When the meat is cooked remove it from the roasting tin along with the vegetables Sprinkle a small amount of plain flour over the meat juices and fat Stir to form a dough or roux by gradually adding the water you ve boiled your accompanying vegetables in John says it works best with cabbage water If you boil things like cabbage you lose nutrients into the water Using that water in the gravy adds an extra little depth it s a way of putting that back into the meal Stir the gravy until all the meat juices and Marmite like deposits on the bottom of the roasting dish have dissolved Add iodised salt to taste and a teaspoon of soy sauce Perhaps a surprising addition soy sauce is a crucial ingredient because it reaches our fifth taste what the Japanese call umami Simmer to reduce the liquid to the right consistency stirring occasionally and then pour all over your traditional roast Souffl Penny Lewis who runs cookery courses at The Culinary Cottage near Abergavenny South Wales which deal with supposedly tricky dishes is confident that anyone can make a souffl that is lovely and light Most people are just frightened of it she says You do need a good whisk and a clean bowl Have it all in place before you start and the oven at the right temperature having the right equipment and ingredients to hand is important so you can time it right Preheat the oven to 200C Generously butter a 15cm souffl dish and coat with finely grated parmesan Separate four large eggs Melt 30g butter in a saucepan stir in 30g of plain flour half a teaspoon of mustard and a pinch of cayenne pepper Cook for a minute or two remove from the heat and stir in 225ml of full fat milk Return it to the heat whisking until thickened and continue to cook for a few minutes while continually whisking Remove from the heat Then stir in between 85g and 110g of either strong cheddar or gruy\u00e8re cheese followed by the egg yolks and salt and pepper Whisk the egg whites in a very clean bowl until they are stiff but not dry Gently fold in the cheese mixture with a metal spoon and pour into a souffl dish Run your thumb around the top edge of the dish for the top hat effect suggests Penny Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until it is golden brown and well risen To check if your souffl is ready open the oven door slightly but not before 20 minutes has elapsed and give the dish a gentle shove if it just wobbles it s ready if it is very wobbly allow five more minutes But the real key to souffl success is to eat it quickly Penny s final rule Make sure your guests are at the table and ready to eat when you get your souffl out of the oven Basmati rice Rice is one of those basic accompaniments that we should all be able to manage yet it so often ends up sticky We turned to Michelin starred chef Alfred Prasad from Indian restaurant Tamarind for his approach It s very easy he says This method applies to all good quality rice First measure your rice in a liquid measurement say 500ml Alfred insists that soaking the rice a process we might be tempted to skip is really important Grains of rice rub against each in the packet which produces a starchy powder and soaking gets rid of that he says After 10 to 15 minutes drain and then rinse the rice two or three times until it is no longer milky Measure your water using double the quantity of rice one litre of water for 500ml of rice Use a vessel at least twice its volume and put the water on to boil As soon as the water is boiling turn down the heat and throw in the soaked rinsed rice People do use salt but it s really not required says Alfred Another useful tip which probably won t go down well with the healthy eating brigade is to add a teaspoon of vegetable oil to keep the rice from sticking Stir the rice a couple of times to stop it from clumping at the bottom Alfred recommends using a spatula rather than a spoon and bring it back to the boil Once you get to the point when there is no more moisture on the top of the rice but while it is still fairly wet at the bottom turn the heat off he says Alfred then leaves the pan open without a lid so that all the excess steam can clear Leave for 10 minutes then transfer to your serving dish Meringues We all dream of fluffy cloud like creations with outer crunch and inner goo but may find ourselves brought back down to earth with browned flattened lumps Lynn Bolton has mastered the art and has up a mail order meringue company Head in the Clouds dedicated to selling her confections She shares her secrets for the classic meringue nest Ensure you have clean bowls and equipment any grease will deflate the meringue she says My Nan taught me to wipe out the bowls and the equipment with vinegar Pre heat the oven to 130C You need 200g of egg whites at room temperature and 400g of good quality white caster sugar If your eggs weigh in at 195g or 210g don t worry just double this weight for the sugar content says Lynn Meringues are pure chemistry sugar and egg white in a ratio of 2 to 1 Weigh the egg white as well as the sugar you can t go wrong Put the egg whites and sugar in a heat proof bowl stir to remove any lumps and place over a saucepan of just boiling water Make sure the bottom of the basin does not touch the water Leave over the water for around eight to 10 minutes stirring occasionally and checking that the sugar has melted Transfer to a mixing bowl to whisk Set a timer for 10 minutes Using an electric whisk beat for five minutes and then add seeds scraped from one vanilla pod and a few drops of vanilla essence Continue beating and feel the bowl as you go it will cool as the air is beaten into the mixture After eight minutes take the beaters out of the meringue and see if it holds its shape If it isn t stiff then beat for a further two minutes and test again before using the mixture Don t over beat the meringue it should be glossy like a gloss paint and not dull says Lynn Transfer the meringue mix on to a large lined baking tray Quickly work the meringue mixture into a round Approximately 200mm circumference so it is still nice and deep says Lynn and make a shallow well in the middle Put into the preheated oven and then immediately turn the temperature down to 110C Cook for three hours Check that the meringue is firm on the base by gently easing it off the tray and tapping it If at any point you think the meringue is going to give stop and cook for a further 30 minutes Once you are happy that it sounds dull this means it is still gooey inside and the base is firm turn the oven off Pastry Some of us might reach for the ready made stuff out of the supermarket freezer section but Gerhard Jenne of London based bakers Konditor Cook insists that making sweet pastry is literally as easy as one two three The recipe we use is very basic it s the 1 2 3 method one part sugar two parts butter and three parts flour You don t even need scales If you want to make it a bit finer you could also add an egg yolk says Gerhard The most important thing is the sugar itself he says Never use granulated sugar it s too coarse and can taste a bit gritty When you bake it the grains go splodgy He recommends using good caster sugar or for a really fine pastry icing sugar Pastry is never going to be a health food and Gerhard refuses to skimp on the salt suggesting that you should add it or use salted butter to bring out the flavour If you re using egg yolk start with the sugar and yolk add the grease and then the flour You can mix it by hand which Gerhard insists is quite easy to do although they use a food processor It comes together fairly quickly but once it is together you don t want to overwork it do it fairly speedily says Gerhard Once you ve got a nice dough don t mess about wrap it in clingfilm and pop it in the fridge to chill for half an hour Once you ve taken it out of the fridge knead it or work it over a couple of times it won t need much pastry is pretty pliable Then roll it out with as little flour as possible You don t want a residue it won t look very nice he adds A common problem with pastry that often it is not cooked properly Gerhard recommends quite a hot oven of between 180C and 200C depending on the size of your dish Cook it until it is golden there s nothing worse than undercooked pale pastry it s a bit insipid White sauce A white sauce or bchamel to give it its more intimidating name is the classic base for many a sauce Top chef Paul Gayler whose book Sauce is dedicated to the art of making a great sauce tells us how to get it lump free Start by halving a small onion and stud each half with two cloves Place in a pan with 600ml of full fat milk and a small bay leaf The onion cloves and bay leaf infuse the milk making it aromatic says Paul Bring the milk to the boil and simmer gently for four to five minutes In another pan make a roux Begin by melting 45g of butter and add 45g of plain flour Cook for 30 to 40 seconds stirring frequently until the roux is pale yellow Make sure you have equal amounts of butter and flour so you get a nice smoothness If you have too much flour it ll be sandy and never cook out Put the milk through a fine strainer then beat it vigorously into the roux and stir until the sauce is smooth Using a wooden spoon to stir it gives it a lovely silky appearance and you can slap the sauce up against the sides says Paul Slowly bring the bchamel to the boil reduce the heat and then simmer it for 20 minutes beating occasionally until the sauce is smooth and glossy Cook it nice and slowly You need to simmer it to allow the flour to cook out Stick it in the

fireplace so smores are a treat that I do not get to enjoy often enough They are such a winning flavor combination ooey gooey creamy marshmallows crunchy graham crackers and of course the delicious melty chocolate So if this girl wants smores she has to improvise a bit and whip them up in the oven I think I have found one heck of a great way to do just that Smores Pops Here s what you need for your indoor smores pops Pretty simple graham crackers marshmallows and chocolate You can also use graham cracker crumbs or sprinkles if you like There is really no scientific formula and you could use miniature marshmallows big marshmallows homemade marshmallows heck you can even use marshmallow fluff Have fun and use what you have Prepare your work area with some wax paper Because I was using full size marshmallows I decided to cut them in half You could do this with a knife kitchen shears a pizza cutter or you could probably even just tear them apart I went with the pizza cutter route A bit sticky but it got the job done After cutting your marshmallows you will want to sit them on your graham crackers I used one large marshmallow per smore You could use more it s really up to your personal taste You can heat your marshmallows two different ways microwave or oven While I love the roasted tops of the marshmallows from the oven honestly for the smore pops I think the microwave works better It makes the marshmallows sticky enough on both sides so that they bind to the graham crackers nicely If you use the microwave it only takes a few seconds literally The marshmallows above were in the microwave less than five seconds Those babies puff up FAST If you put the marshmallows in the oven as shown above without the top graham cracker on them you will have to work a bit more to get the top graham cracker to stay in place I achieved this by smooshing the gooey marshmallow around the sides Sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do I m thinking that if you put the top marshmallow on before putting it in the oven the grahams will stay put though you will lose a bit of the crunchy cooked marshmallow taste I baked this tray of marshmallows for about 2 3 minutes at 425 degrees After they come out of the oven or microwave you will want to get the top graham crackers onto the marshmallows quickly You will have some ooze out the sides but that s okay The entire thing is going to be covered in chocolate so neatness really isn t a concern After putting the tops on you can slip your sticks into the marshmallows You can skip this part if you don t want to go the pop route After putting the graham cracker tops on and inserting the sticks you will want to let these set up for a bit An hour is enough time you just want the marshmallows to firm back up a bit Once the marshmallows are set up you can melt your chocolate Follow the directions on your package of chocolate You will want to make sure the melted chocolate cools a little bit before dipping otherwise you ll have a gooey mess But a delicious one I don t actually dip mine as I never have that much chocolate I use a small bowl and do a combo of dipping in chocolate and spooning on the chocolate Make sure to tap tap tap to get the excess drippy chocolate off Not that excess chocolate is ever a bad thing but it can be quite a mess After dipping in chocolate you can sprinkle the tops with graham cracker crumbs graham cracker chunks chocolate chips sprinkles or whatever else your little heart desires I sit mine on wax paper and let the chocolate set for an hour or so The time for the chocolate to set will vary based on the chocolate you use how hot it is the weather and possibly your astrological sign Okay maybe not that last one After that you are ready to ENJOY These are crazy good plain and simple Yum Smores on a stick Smores pops One thing that could make these even more outrageous would be to add in chocolate to the center of the smore I m going to have to give that a try next time I make them Without a stick Still JUST as tasty When I leave out the stick I do not completely cover them in chocolate Mainly because I don t want to get my hands all covered in chocolate I have a weird OCD issue with that I m a big fan of nice clean hands but that s another story And if you have the willpower to not devour them all in one sitting and can manage to give some away simply adding a cellophane bag and some ribbon will create a cute gift or favor Quick delicious and no campfire required However If you prefer you can sit around and sing kum ba yah and pretend you have that campfire part I m pretty much satisfied with the chocolate part though graham crackers and marshmallows are covered in chocolate and served on a stick for these easy and delicious smores pops. smores, smores

s Breakfast Recipe and Macronutrient Breakdown Below You have to laugh In today s world of industrially engineered food and drink the term energy drink is merely euphemism for sugar drink Yea some are laced with caffein for added energy And naturally engineering being what it is you don t even have to look to know that cans of that crap probably contain upwards of 8 teaspoons and more of sugar in a single can There are 4 grams in a tsp of sugar all carbohydrate so an energy drink sporting 30 grams of rapidly assimilating carbohydrate in liquid form is about 7 8 teaspoons Now let me ask a dumb question How many of you would put 8 teaspoons of sugar into any 10 or 12 oz unsweetened drink Anyway enough of that nonsense As anyone with an ounce of true nutritional sense knows fat is the ultimate source of energy both dietary and body fat It s simple A gram of carbohydrate like sugar or HFCS has 4 kilocalories of energy while a gram of fat has 9 more than twice as much gram for gram But there s one kind of fat that s a bit special medium chain triglyceride MCT What s special about it MCTs passively diffuse from the GI tract to the portal system longer fatty acids are absorbed into the lymphatic system without requirement for modification like long chain fatty acids or very long chain fatty acids In addition MCTs do not require bile salts for digestion Patients that have malnutrition or malabsorption syndromes are treated with MCTs because they do not require energy for absorption utilization or storage Coconut oil is composed of approximately 66 medium chain triglycerides Other rich sources of MCTs include palm kernel oils and camphor tree drupes The fatty acids found in MCTs are called medium chain fatty acids You usually have to dig a bit if you don t already know to discover that these MCTs are SATURATED FATS Or should I say arterycloggingsaturatedfat Another thing to note is that they digest rapidly like sugar in a drink and so are truly in the category of supplying rapid energy the whole point of an energy drink or glucose gel such as endurance athletes use But guess what Little to no glycemic load They don t spike your blood sugar to significant degree and thus don t spike your insulin significantly leaving you to later need another energy drink and another and another Peak valley peak valley wash rinse repeat There s more Turns out that MCTs have other huge benefits in terms of blood sugar control in diabetics as well as actual fat loss Yea a fat that makes you lose body fat Let s take a look at what the scientistas have to say Pubmed Greater rise in fat oxidation with medium chain triglyceride consumption relative to long chain triglyceride is associated with lower initial body weight and greater loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue CONCLUSION These data suggest that shunting of dietary fat towards oxidation results in diminished fat storage as reflected by the loss of BW and subcutaneous adipose tissue Furthermore MCT consumption may stimulate EE and fat oxidation to a lower extent in men of greater BW compared to men of lower BW indicative of the lower responsiveness to a rapidly oxidized fat by overweight men This was a randomized crossover controlled feeding trail Subjects got either high amounts of MCT or LCT olive oil Crossover means that each group was subjected to both diets which is gold standard Those on MCT lost almost twice as much fat as those on LCT ScienceDirect Medium chain triglycerides Abstract chemical and physical properties of MCFAs show substantial metabolic differences MCFAs do not require binding to proteins such as fatty acid binding protein fatty acid transport protein and or fatty acid translocase FAT homolog to human platelet CD36 MCFAs are a preferred source of energy \u03b2 oxidation MCFAs are also incorporated into adipose tissue triglycerides and may influence adipose tissue and other systemic functions more substantially than previously assumed MCTs reduce fat mass through down regulation of adipogenic genes as well as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor \u03b3 Recent studies confirmed the potential of MCFAs to reduce body weight and particularly body fat This effect was not transient MCFAs reduce lipoprotein secretion and attenuate postprandial triglyceride response It was however frequently observed that MCTs increase fasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels But given in moderate amounts in diets with moderate fat supply MCFAs may actually reduce fasting lipid levels more than oils rich in mono or polyunsaturated fatty acids The same is true for glucose levels MCTs improved several features contributing to enhanced insulin sensitivity Under certain in vitro conditions MCTs exert proinflammatory effects but in vivo MCTs may reduce intestinal injury and protect from hepatotoxicity This is just a review article looking at studies demonstrating a lot of the benefits of MCTs that we re talking about Do note the warning siren about elevated fasting cholesterol and triglycerides Of course this is just the abstract such that some news media regurgitator in the Health section can write a dumbshit headline like Coconut Milk Raises Cholesterol Levels Study Finds Then you tear into the full text and find it wasn t significant it was one poorly controlled study out of many or some other BS And who cares about cholesterol numbers anyway Cool that it may also may aid intestinal repair and protect your liver from drug or alcohol induced toxicity important for those on medications or who drink regularly More Hell I don t do science that often anymore so let s go all out But in consideration of the environment let s save some space and you can click over to the abstracts you want to read PubMed Physiological effects of medium chain triglycerides potential agents in the prevention of obesity PubMed Medium chain fatty acid metabolism and energy expenditure obesity treatment implications PubMed Medium chain fatty acids as metabolic therapy in cardiac disease the heart muscle loves ketone bodies I ve heard Ed PubMed Medium chain fatty acids functional lipids for the prevention and treatment of the metabolic syndrome Well here s one from 1986 that bears quoting the entire abstract especially in view of the recipe for my secret energy drink below PubMed Medium chain triglycerides MCT in aging and arteriosclerosis Abstract Some of the nutritional work with triglycerides consisting mainly of C8 and C10 fatty acids MCT lends itself to speculations about their influence on arteriosclerosis Arteriosclerosis is thought to be part of the normal aging process which is due to age associated molecular biological changes The lipid theory of arteriosclerosis is rejected Pertinent studies with MCT include these observations Feeding of MCT to rats resulted in animals of low body weight small fat deposits and excellent survival rate This deserves emphasis because of the beneficial influence of low body weight on aging and arteriosclerosis MCT feeding was associated with low linoleate and low tocopherol requirements in rats This may lead to reduced formation of those linoleate derived prostaglandins which favor thrombosis formation Lower linoleate requirements may also lead to the presence of fewer uncontrolled free radicals in the cells MCT feeding is associated with low levels of serum and liver cholesterol involving speculations that tissue conditions are such that an adaptive increase of cholesterol is unnecessary The Demographic Yearbook of the United Nations 1978 reported that Sri Lanka has the lowest death rate from ischemic heart disease Sri Lanka is the only of the countries giving reliable data where coconut oil containing over 50 medium chain fatty acids is the main dietary fat emphasis added So while it doesn t say how much saturated fat the lowest death rate from heart disease Sri Lankans ate we do have an idea for another population the Tokelauans who eat about 50 of energy from saturated fat and have no evidence of heart disease I blogged about it way back here There was one other issue I wanted to cover and that s the potential insulin stimulating effects of MCTs if any and whether coconut milk with 1 gram of carbohydrate per ounce could present any problem to diabetics I dug all over the place got lots of help from Twitter peeps thanks much all of you but in the end could not really come to firm conclusions so I ll leave that to comments Other than that there s this interesting conversation between Marty Gallagher and Dr Chris Hardy at PrecisionNutrition on MCTs coconut oil and coconut milk in both a health and training context Good stuff Alright now while I certainly didn t need to do all this sciency researchin to know that a natural product like coconut milk would be like most wholesome food good for me I want to make sure you have confidence dear reader that indeed it is safe to go back in the water The sharks are all over at Jamba Juice getting their faux health smoothies count how many of those sugar drinks have over 100g of sugar Nope what you ll get here is a smoothie an energy drink that will blow the lid off all that crap in a cup in terms of sustained level energy and satiation and well you ve seen the potential numerous health and weight loss and control benefits Incidentally coconut fat is about 90 saturated Of the saturated fat 66 is comprised of MCTs And by the way I ve used both coconut oil and coconut milk in cooking for years particularly for Thai curries Also last year at NovNat over a week we probably each had near or more than a can of coconut milk every morning see the top pic and I for one was rarely ever hungry much for lunch in spite of the activity though I ate big every meal And I lost 3 pounds over the week and felt great Alright the recipe 1 cup full fat coconut milk I like Native Forrest 1 4 cup water 2 raw egg yolks don t eat whites raw cook them to destroy avidin an

irritating to the mouth throat and stomach if ingested in too high a quantity But it has its benefits Vinegar is thought to help slow the rise in blood glucose after a meal essentially lowering the glycemic index of a meal and it may also help with blood pressure control It used to be one of those old wives tales swallow a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar before your meals and you ll rev up your metabolism Vinegar supposedly helps curb appetite and cut cravings But until lately there was no credible research proving any of this However Japanese scientists have found that there may actually be something to vinegar and weight loss The researchers gave two groups of mice white vinegar in various concentrations via a stomach tube and gave another group of mice water Both groups were fed a high fat diet The vinegar fed mice had 10 less body fat than the water fed mice Vinegar contains acetic acid which may turn on genes that signal the body to break down fat preventing it from accumulating in body tissue Should you take vinegar for weight loss It s hard to say It s certainly fine to use vinegar as a marinade or in salad dressings If you decide to try it before meals dilute it with some water to reduce possible irritation Spicy FoodsDo you love hot spicy dishes Is Tabasco sauce one of your must have condiments If so you may be in luck with regard to your

helps burn calories But unless you eat spicy foods constantly and maybe you do the amount of calories that you actually burn may be negligible And the effect on metabolism only lasts for about 30 minutes However spicy foods may offer another benefit making you feel more full In fact in one study men who were fed appetizers seasoned with hot sauce before eating a meal ate about 200 fewer calories than men who didn t eat the hot sauce The researchers think that the sauce which contained capsaicin the chemical that makes certain peppers hot helped to blunt their appetites So spice up your meals with some red pepper flakes hot sauce or even ginger But be careful if you have heartburn as these spices may aggravate the condition Green TeaGreen tea has received a lot of press over the past few years particularly in the realm of helping to fight heart disease and some types of cancer Green tea is rich in certain polyphenols types of antioxidants called catechins that have anti inflammatory and anticancer properties But green tea may do more than fight disease Some evidence shows that drinking green tea may also help with weight loss In one study Japanese men were given oolong tea infused with green tea extract A control group drank oolong tea without green tea extract After three months those who drank the green tea extract lost an average of 5 3 pounds while those who didn t drink the extract lost only 2 9 pounds And in research looking at mice prone to obesity those who ate food containing green tea extract gained less weight and body fat It may be that the catechins in the green tea increase thermogenesis or the burning of calories as body heat At any rate if you re thinking of trying green tea to help with your weight be prepared to drink between 4 to 7 cups of it each day EggsOK eggs don t have magical fat burning properties although to be honest not many foods actually do But a study published last year in the International Journal of Obesity showed that men and women who ate two eggs for breakfast as part of a lower calorie diet lost 65 more weight and had a 34 greater reduction in their waist circumference than men and women who ate a bagel for breakfast The secret Eggs very likely increased satiety a feeling of fullness so that folks ended up eating less I ve mentioned eggs in previous postings they can be part of pretty much anyone s eating plan So maybe there aren t any foods that will melt away the fat But the foods I ve mentioned above can certainly be part of an eating plan geared to help you lose and maintain a

your brain and body"",""body"":""Alcohol like caffeine has an enormous reputation but loose understanding in popular culture Learn how it s absorbed and how fast why it s essential to reality TV altercations its paradoxical sexual effects and its life lengthening potential whether red wine or Bud Light Image via TheDeliciousLife Everyone it seems takes their cues on how alcohol affects the mind and body from an eclectic mix of knowledge personal experience pop culture tall tales of long nights the latest studies to make the health news wires and second hand tips You might have gathered that alcohol is a depressant that it s dehydrating that you can drink about one drink an hour and stay relatively sober Some of that is true But much of it depends on a large number of factors Let s dig into some of the things we do and don t know about alcohol Relevant sources are linked where cited but much of the background material comes from Buzz The Science and Lore of Alcohol and Caffeine new ish Kindle edition linked there It s a science based tome written in a clear language by Stephen Braun and was the main reference for our take on caffeine We re taking a few things for granted here that you understand some of the basics of alcohol consumption blood alcohol content legal limits what it feels like when you ve had too much to drink and the serious illness of alcoholism We re not trying to help you get loaded quicker or drink more for longer periods We re digging into some of the science behind how you and alcohol interact It Works Differently on Full Stomachs Young Women Some Asians and Aspirin Takers Your body sees alcohol as a poison or at least as something it doesn t actually want inside it To fight back and sober you up humans produce an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase That enzyme gets its shot at your alcohol when it attempts to pass through the stomach lining and when it reaches your liver primarily On contact it snatches a hydrogen atom off the ethanol molecules in your drink rendering it into non intoxicating acetaldehyde Humans can then use aldehyde dehydrogenase as a kind of clean up crew breaking down the acetaldehyde that s sometimes considered a cause of hangovers along with dehydration For more on the myths versus reality of hangovers see our guide to hangover cures Image via Wikimedia Commons Seems pretty simple no It s a fight between how much you can drink versus how fast your enzymes can bust down your indulgences and their byproducts But many factors affect certain people s production of the two alcohol crushing compounds Alcohol dehydrogenase AD is for reasons not wholly understood more effective in men than in women Young men in fact may have up to 70 to 80 percent greater enzyme activity in the presence of alcohol But men s AD effectiveness also drops off with age at a faster rate than in women such that by around 55 or 60 men may find themselves able to handle less alcohol than their female counterparts all other factors being equal A full stomach helps break down alcohol but not because your food soaks up the alcohol When you eat a big meal your stomach s pyloric sphincter a kind of release valve into the small intestine closes tightly Your body knows that you ve got food that should get a good going over in your stomach before it heads straight to the high absorption small intestine so it keeps it there and the AD in your stomach has more time to work on the alcohol Drink on an empty stomach and the liquid quickly makes it into the small intestine where there s more than 200 square meters of surface area for absorption into your body Image via peretzpup Another big factor in alcohol absorption and alcohol s effects is genetics Your great great grandparents have a say in how buzzed your Friday night gets for sure but for roughly one third to half of Asian drinkers it s more than a slight variance Alcohol flush reaction a flushing of the face when drinking occurs because the enzyme clean up crew aldehyde dehydrogenase is mutated by just one amino acid That changes how effective its molecules are in bonding with and busting up acetaldehyde With excess acetaldehyde in their system those with a flush reaction get red faced and can experience heart palpitations dizziness and severe nausea in extreme cases Your own genetic makeup of AD and aldehyde dehydrogenase affect your ability to break down alcohol and its byproducts in similar fashion Don t take aspirin before drinking unless you love hangovers Aspirin seriously cuts the effectiveness of your body s AD enzymes In one 1990 study the average blood alcohol levels of those who took two maximum strength aspirin tablets before drinking were an average of 26 percent higher than those who were aspirin free Other studies have suggested even more impact on your body s ability to break down alcohol That also means more acetaldehyde in your system down the line so you ll learn your lesson quickly if you re considering aspirin as a helper Side Note Absorption and Elimination Is a Curve Not a Straight Line Think you ve got a handle on the basic one drink per hour algorithm for your weekend nights Check out this explainer from a forensic toxicology lab which also links up an advanced Blood Alcohol Calculator Your BAC moves through plateaus responds differently to drinks higher than 20 25 percent alcohol by volume and eliminates some alcohol in pure form which is how police can measure it on your breath It Extends Your Life Kind Of Every few weeks it seems a new study suggests a glass of wine or sometimes any old drink lengthens your life if you don t overdo it Plucking just one out of the pile you ll see that in Alcoholism Clinical and Experimental Research researchers followed 1824 people over a total of 20 years as they aged between 55 and 65 Of those who abstained entirely 69 percent died Among those who drank in moderate amounts 41 percent died which was 23 percent less than the light drinkers Even heavy drinkers fared better than abstainers with just 61 percent passing away during the study period How could a substance that everybody and their five brothers tell you to go easy on extend your life Popular theories center on the antioxidants and resveratrol compounds found in wines or on the studies showing alcohol as increasing levels of HDL good cholesterol But Jonah Lehrer at Wired points out the not so obvious the link between a longer life and alcohol may not be direct but it s likely very real It relates to the long term benefits of reducing stress as well as alcohol s role in facilitating get togethers and acting as a social lubricant What does this have to do with longevity In recent years sociologists and epidemiologists have begun studying the long term effects Direct PDF link of loneliness It turns out to be really dangerous We are social primates and when we re cut off from the social network we are more likely to die from just about everything but especially heart disease At this point the link between abstinence and social isolation is merely hypothetical But given the extensive history of group drinking it s what we do when we come together it seems likely that drinking in moderation makes it easier for us develop and nurture relationships And it s these relationships that help keep us alive Image via LINXBAS Theoretically then you might get some of the same benefits if you were a savvy social Diet Coke drinker But it s likely a combination of actual alcohol effects along with their social expressions that leads to study after study showing drinkers as getting some kind of life extending benefit It Doesn t Kill Brain Cells but Does Inhibit Them It s true that at high concentrations like the nearly 100 percent pure alcohol used in sterilizing solutions alcohol can indeed kill cells and neurons and nearly anything else But given that the blood reaching your brain is only at 0 08 percent alcohol if you re legally intoxicated or say 0 25 percent if you ve just closed a major deal in Tokyo it s not doing a lot of damage to your actual brain cells liver cells and other organs with long term chronic abuse are another matter Don t believe it A major study by Grethe Jensen and colleagues in 1993 matched brain samples taken from both alcoholics and nonalcoholics from groups of the two dead from non alcohol related causes There were no significant differences found in either the number or density of brain cells between the groups Misconception Junction tackles Jensen s study and the topic in more depth What alcohol can and does do to your brain is affect the way your neurons get their firing triggers from glutamate It infiltrates the glutamate receptors in your synapses hurting their ability to send off their normal fire messages Alcohol has this impact all across your brain the parts that control muscles speech coordination judgment and so on Keep that in mind the next time you or someone else claims that they drive golf or otherwise perform some task better with alcohol s help As Stephen Braun puts it in Buzz The Science and Lore of Alcohol and Caffeine Substances such as cocaine and LSD work like pharmacological scalpels altering the functioning of only one or a handful of brain circuits Alcohol is more like a pharmacological hand grenade It affects practically everything around it Side Note That s Also Why It Uh Inhibits Sex The studies and implications are numerous to say the least but if you want a thumbnail understanding of how alcohol as Shakespeare put it provokes the desire but takes away the performance it has to do with the firing of nerves in the brain and elsewhere that would relax the arteries enough to get both parties moving It s a bit more complex than that and drinking in moderation can be a net benefit in some cases but alcohol paradoxically doesn t help one specific region of your self to relax Side Note 2 Alcohol is Particularly Effective at Inhibiting Memories Like the sexual response the way the brain makes memories is far from comprehensively understood But it does seem linked to N Methyl D aspartic acid or NMDA the receptor for which alcohol seems particularly adept at interfering with according to Braun Studies have shown that while subjects under alcohol s influence can recall existing memories events happening during inebriation are regularly hard to remember It varies with the amount consumed and seems to top out at a serious 0 2 percent blood alcohol content but anything from flimsy recall to full on blackouts are possible due to alcohol s unique bond with the stuff that should make memories It Makes Other People Seem More Intentional If you d never been raised to think things through you d assume that most actions people took were fairly intentional and possibly pointed at causing you harm The same holds when people are asked to make snap judgments about things happening But give yourself any amount of time and you ll generally think out all the reasons something could have happened avoiding your natural intentionality bias and preventing heated arguments with otherwise close friends bar altercations and 80 percent of all reality show plots Image via terren in Virginia But as you might have guessed that reasoned thinking gets lost when there s a night s worth of alcohol moving through your brain In the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin researchers detail a study with 92 men made to go three hours without food then given a shot of either juice or juice with more than a shot of pure alcohol All the glasses were rimmed with alcohol to mask the placebos The men thought they took part in a taste test then did unrelated tasks for 30 minutes After that they were asked to determine whether a series of deliberate accidental or vague stated actions He deleted the email She looked for her keys She tripped on the jump rope etc were deliberate or accidental Ars Technica sums up the results Nearly all the participants no matter what condition judged all the unambiguous statements correctly However when the actions were ambiguous and could have been performed either intentionally or unintentionally the drunk participants were much more likely to perceive the actions as deliberate than the sober participants were The study showed that it didn t much matter whether a man thought he was drunk the jump to conclusions about an intention only took place when someone actually did have too much in them It s a Terrible Sleep Aid Ever heard the term nightcap People have long believed that alcohol helps you get to sleep and that part can be true for some Once you re asleep though alcohol s interaction with your brain can lead to some fitful sleep and no sleep at all especially if you consumed caffeine anytime close to hitting the pillow Image via Ella s Dad Just as with caffeine your brain proves remarkably adept at adapting itself and responding to the ethanol molecules jamming up its receptors and interfering with neuron firings It takes a bit for the brain to catch up though and when your brain starts kicking in and reclaiming all its nooks and crannies it can wreak havoc on your crucial REM sleep along with your more passive general resting If you ve had caffeine too it s a drug that can take up to 5 hours to break down half a dose If it s in your system at the same time as your brain is trying to compensate for alcohol the combined revenge of both drugs can lead to some fairly restless sleep according to Braun s

peel This tart has a soft smooth and tangy lemon filling which is similar in texture to a baked custard We like the filling to be quite tangy but if you would prefer a milder flavour the tart will still turn out well if the amount of lemon juice in the filling is reduced to 125ml 1 2 cup The filling is partially cooked on the stovetop before being oven baked in a precooked pastry case The buttery pastry can be difficult to work with If you don t wish to roll the pastry out or if it breaks when you are lifting it into the pan you can use your fingers to press the dough evenly over the base and up the side of the tart pan If desired the pastry case can be baked the day before filling and stored in an airtight container at room temperature Serves about 9 10 We use a 20ml tablespoon and 250ml measuring cup for all of our recipes Pastry162g 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon plain flour38g 1 4 cup self raising flour60g 1 3 cup firmly packed pure icing sugar sifted100g cold butter chopped into about 15 pieces1 large egg yolk we use eggs with a minimum weight of 59g Lemon Filling4 large eggs we use eggs with a minimum weight of 59g 40g 2 tablespoons plus 1 2 teaspoon butter chopped into a few pieces166ml 2 3 cup cream 35 to 40 percent fat 166ml 2 3 cup fresh lemon juice200g 3 4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugarPastryPlace plain flour self raising flour and icing sugar in a food processor and process on medium speed for about 20 seconds to combine the ingredients Add the cold butter to the flour mixture Process on medium speed for about 15 seconds until only tiny lumps of butter remain any butter pieces should be smaller than a grain of rice Add the egg yolk to the processor and process on medium speed until the yolk is incorporated and the mixture just starts to clump together about 30 60 seconds During processing you may need to stop the machine and run a spatula around the side at the base of the bowl to dislodge any unincorporated ingredients Remove the processor blade and use your hand to press the dough clumps together into a mass Tip the dough onto a large sheet of baking paper the paper can be reused when rolling out the pastry Use your hands to bring the pastry together into a smooth ball Form the pastry into a disc shape Wrap pastry disc with plastic wrap or place in a freezer bag and refrigerate for two to three hours After at least two hours resting time remove the pastry from the refrigerator and leave it at room temperature for 10 30 minutes until just soft enough to roll out the time required will depend on the temperature of the room Adjust the oven rack to the lowest shelf position the pastry base will brown and crisp better if it is close to the bottom element If possible set your oven so that the top and bottom elements are on and the fan if present is off Then preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius If you have a fan forced oven and aren t able to turn the fan off preheat your oven to 160 degrees Celsius Place unwrapped pastry disc between two large sheets of baking paper Using a rolling pin roll pastry out to form a 29cm diameter circle The pastry circle should be just large enough to line the pan if you make the circle much larger the pastry will be too thin When rolling the pastry out you may find that the edges of the pastry start to develop large cracks as in the photo below If this happens use your fingers to press the pastry back together to repair the cracks The bottom sheet of baking paper may develop creases during rolling These creases can make deep cuts in the pastry To help prevent this we do the following once or twice during rolling 1 Leave the pastry between the two sheets of baking paper Flip the paper and pastry over so the bottom sheet of baking paper is now on the top 2 Lift the top sheet of baking paper off the pastry to remove the creases and then place the paper down again and continue rolling Ensure the pastry shape is as round as possible If it isn t round the pastry may not completely line the pan Once the pastry is rolled out to the desired size we briefly place it in the freezer to make it easier to work with and help prevent it from breaking when transferring to the pan We leave the pastry between the sheets of baking paper place it flat on a large tray board and put it in the freezer for 2 3 minutes to firm up exclusivelyfood com auWhen you are ready to transfer the pastry to the pan loosen the top sheet of baking paper by lifting it off the pastry and then placing it back down Keeping the pastry between the two sheets of baking paper flip the paper and pastry over so the bottom sheet of paper is now on the top Remove the top sheet of baking paper This process of loosening the paper makes it easier to lift the pastry off the baking paper when transferring the pastry to the pan You will need a 3cm deep 23cm base diameter loose bottomed tart pan If you have experience lining tart pans with pastry you can ignore the next paragraph The following instructions for lifting the pastry into the pan would probably suit left handed people so use the opposite sides hands if you prefer Place the pan to the right of the pastry round With your left hand hold the rolling pin above the pastry Work quickly to help prevent the pastry from breaking Use the baking paper to lift the right side of the pastry up and drape it over the rolling pin Leave the pastry resting on the rolling pin and return the baking paper in your hand to the bench Slide your right hand between the pastry and baking paper still resting on the bench Lift the pastry with your right hand and move the pastry to the left side of the tart pan When the pastry is in the correct position slide your right hand to the right using it to support the pastry as you roll it off the rolling pin and into the pan Ease the pastry into the pan Fold down any pastry that extends above the top rim of the pan and press it onto the edge crust to reinforce Trim the edges of the pastry to neaten Place pastry in freezer for 15 minutes Scrunch one of the sheets of baking paper that you used when rolling the pastry until the paper is soft and pliable Flatten the sheet of baking paper and use it to line the pastry case Then half fill the case with raw rice dried beans or pie weights and gently push the rice weights up against the side of the case to support the edge crust Place pan on the lowest oven rack and bake pastry for 25 minutes Remove pastry from oven and carefully lift the baking paper and rice weights out of the pastry case Return the pastry to the lowest oven rack and bake for about 10 minutes until a light golden colour Place pan on a wire rack and allow pastry to cool for at least 30 minutes before starting filling FillingWhen ready to start the filling preheat oven to 160 degrees Celsius 140 degrees Celsius fan forced You will need a double boiler or a medium large saucepan and a large heatproof bowl that is wider than the saucepan One quarter fill the saucepan with water Sit the bowl on top of the saucepan and check that the base of the bowl doesn t touch the water use a different bowl if necessary Remove the bowl and bring the saucepan of water to the simmer Place eggs in the bowl and lightly whisk with a fork or whisk to combine but not aerate Add butter cream lemon juice and sugar to the bowl and use a heatproof spatula to stir to combine the butter won t combine with the other ingredients at this stage Sit the bowl on top of the saucepan and stir the mixture constantly with the spatula scraping the base and side of the bowl to prevent the mixture sticking to the bowl and overcooking You may need to adjust the heat to keep the water at a simmer don t allow the water to boil Continue stirring the mixture until it thickens slightly and a thin layer clings to the spatula about 15 20 minutes If you draw your finger across the spatula a clear trail should remain in the filling clinging to the spatula You will probably notice small white pieces of egg in the filling one such piece is shown on the spatula below Strain the filling into the pastry case to remove the lumps of egg Smooth the surface of the filling with the spatula or the back of a spoon Baking Serving and StorageBake for about 18 20 minutes on the lowest oven rack The tart filling should be set around the edges and the centre should be slightly wobbly when the tart is gently shaken Place tart on a wire rack to cool completely The tart can be served at room temperature or refrigerated until cold Serve with whipped cream or ice cream if desired The tart is best eaten on the day of making as the filling will soften the pastry over time Store tart in an airtight container in the refrigerator Not suitable to freeze www

deficiency of this mineral These recommendations are not comprehensive and are not intended to replace the advice of your doctor or pharmacist Continue reading the full acne vulgaris article for more in depth fully referenced information on medicines vitamins herbs and dietary and lifestyle changes that may be helpful About acne vulgaris Acne vulgaris also known as common acne is an inflammatory condition of the sebaceous glands of the skin It consists of red elevated areas on the skin that may develop into pustules and even further into cysts that can cause scarring Acne vulgaris occurs mostly on the face neck and back of most commonly teenagers and to a lesser extent of young adults The condition results in part from excessive stimulation of the skin by androgens male hormones Bacterial infection of the skin also appears to play a role Product ratings for acne vulgaris Science Ratings Nutritional Supplements Herbs Niacinamide topical Zinc Tea tree oil topical Guggul Pantothenic acid Vitamin A Vitamin B6 Burdock Vitex associated with menstrual cycle See also Homeopathic Remedies for Acne What are the symptoms Acne is a skin condition characterized by pimples which may be closed sometimes called pustules or whiteheads or open blackheads on the face neck chest back and shoulders Most acne is mild although some people experience inflammation with larger cysts which may result in scarring Dietary changes that may be helpful Many people assume certain aspects of diet are linked to acne but there is not much evidence to support this idea Preliminary research found for example that chocolate was not implicated 1 Similarly though a diet high in iodine can create an acne like rash in a few people this is rarely the cause of acne In a preliminary study foods that patients believed triggered their acne failed to cause problems when tested in a clinical setting 2 Some doctors of natural medicine have observed that food allergy plays a role in some cases of acne particularly adult acne 3 However that observation has not been supported by scientific studies Vitamins that may be helpful In a double blind trial topical application of a 4 niacinamide gel twice daily for two months resulted in significant in improvement in people with acne 4 However there is little reason to believe this vitamin would have similar actions if taken orally Several double blind trials indicate that zinc supplements reduce the severity of acne 567 8 In one double blind trial 9 though not in another 10 zinc was found to be as effective as oral antibiotic therapy Doctors sometimes suggest that people with acne take 30 mg of zinc two or three times per day for a few months then 30 mg per day thereafter It often takes 12 weeks before any improvement is seen Long term zinc supplementation requires 1 2 mg of copper per day to prevent copper deficiency Large quantities of vitamin A such as 300 000 IU per day for females and 400 000 500 000 IU per day for males have been used successfully to treat severe acne 11 However unlike the long lasting benefits of the synthetic prescription version of vitamin A isotretinoin as Accutane the acne typically returns several months after natural vitamin A is discontinued In addition the large amounts of vitamin A needed to control acne can be toxic and should be used only under careful medical supervision In a preliminary trial people with acne were given 2 5 grams of pantothenic acid orally four times per day for a total of 10 grams per day a remarkably high amount 12 A cream containing 20 pantothenic acid was also applied topically four to six times per day With moderate acne near complete relief was seen within two months while severe conditions took at least six months to respond Eventually the intake of pantothenic acid was reduced to 1 to 5 grams per day still a very high amount A preliminary report suggested that vitamin B6 at 50 mg per day may alleviate premenstrual flare ups of acne experienced by some women 13 While no controlled research has evaluated this possibility an older controlled trial of resistant adolescent acne found that 50 250 mg per day decreased skin oiliness and improved acne in 75 of the participants 14 However another preliminary report suggested that vitamin B6 supplements might exacerbate acne vulgaris 15 Are there any side effects or interactions Refer to the individual supplement for information about any side effects or interactions Herbs that may be helpful A clinical trial compared the topical use of 5 tea tree oil to 5 benzoyl peroxide for common acne Although the tea tree oil was slower and less potent in its action it had far fewer side effects and was thus considered more effective overall 16 One controlled trial found that guggul Commiphora mukul compared favorably to tetracycline in the treatment of cystic acne 17 The amount of guggul extract taken in the trial was 500 mg twice per day Historically tonic herbs such as burdock have been used in the treatment of skin conditions These herbs are believed to have a cleansing action when taken internally 18 Burdock root tincture may be taken in the amount of 2 to 4 ml per day Dried root preparations in a capsule or tablet can be used at 1 to 2 grams three times per day Many herbal preparations combine burdock root with other alterative herbs such as yellow dock red clover or cleavers In the treatment of acne none of these herbs has been studied in scientific research Some older preliminary German research suggests that vitex might contribute to clearing of premenstrual acne possibly by regulating hormonal influences on acne 19 Women in these studies used 40 drops of a concentrated liquid product once daily 20 Are there any side effects or interactions Refer to the individual herb for information about any side effects or interactions Holistic approaches that may be helpful Acupuncture may be helpful in the treatment of acne Several preliminary studies have reported that a series of acupuncture treatments 8 to 15 is markedly effective or curative in 90 to 98 of patients 212223 Besides traditional Chinese acupuncture using needles alone a technique called cupping is frequently used in the treatment of acne Cupping refers to the use of cup shaped instruments to apply suction to the area being needled Two preliminary trials of cupping treatment for acne reported marked improvement in 91 to 96 of the study participants 2425 Controlled trials are necessary to determine the true efficacy of acupuncture and other traditional Chinese therapies in the treatment of acne Some hypnotherapists believe that hypnosis might help prevent facial scarring associated with acne In one case study a patient was instructed to say the word scar in place of picking her face and the scratch marks resolved The underlying acne was unaffected 26 References To view roll mouse over the References heading to hide click on the heading 1 Fulton JE Jr Plewig G Kligman AM

Richard Rhodes At the height of her Hollywood career actress Hedy Lamarr was known as the most beautiful woman in the world For most of her life her legacy was her looks But in the 1940s in an attempt to help the war effort she quietly invented what would become the precursor to many wireless technologies we use today including Bluetooth GPS cellphone networks and more An Unlikely Beginning A new book by Pulitzer Prize winning author Richard Rhodes sets out to rewrite America s memory of Lamarr Hedy s Folly The Life and Breakthrough Inventions of Hedy Lamarr The Most Beautiful Woman in the World chronicles her life and the inventive side that is not often mentioned Rhodes tells Rachel Martin guest host of weekends on All Things Considered that Lamarr had been fascinated with science as a child growing up in Austria but pursued acting instead Her first break into Hollywood came when she heard Louis Mayer of Metro Goldwyn Mayer studios was scouting for actors She went to see him in London He wasn t willing to offer her a very good deal so she said no and walked out having great confidence in herself Rhodes says When Lamarr found out Mayer was headed back to the United States she bought a ticket for the same boat Once she was aboard she found a way to make him long for her after all she was an actress And before the ship landed in New York she had a much much better contract the equivalent of about 3 000 a week for seven years he says Within a year with the appearance of her in the film Algiers opposite Charles Boyer she was a superstar Un Hollywood Rhodes says Lamarr was most often cast based on her looks and had few lines She quickly grew bored in Hollywood Hedy didn t drink She didn t like to party he says Her idea of a good evening was a quiet dinner party with some intelligent friends where they could discuss ideas which sounds so un Hollywood but Hedy had to find something else to do to occupy her time Rhodes says she had a drafting table installed in her house and started inventing Among her projects was an improved stoplight and a tablet that when dissolved in water created a soda similar to Coca Cola She laughed later and said Well it never really

author of more than 20 fiction and nonfiction books Inspired By War As she was inventing Rhodes says Lamarr was simultaneously glued to the events of World War II When German submarines began targeting passenger cruise liners he says she felt compelled to invent something to help the Allied cause She zeroed in on torpedoes which were powerful weapons but hard to control Rhodes says she thought that if they could be radio guided there was a better chance they would hit their target She understood that the problem with radio signals was that they could be jammed But if you could make the signal hop around more or less randomly from radio frequency to radio frequency then the person at the other end trying to jam the signal won t know where it is he says If they try to jam one particular frequency it might hit that frequency on one of its hops but it would only be there for a fraction of a second Thus her take on spread spectrum radio was born Lamarr and her co inventor composer George Antheil submitted their idea to the National Inventor s Council and received a patent for their Secret Communication System in 1942 They were anxious to share their invention with the Navy but got a lackluster response The Navy being the Navy if it hadn t been able to make a torpedo that worked obviously it wasn t going to be receptive to ideas coming in from outside Rhodes says The Navy basically threw it into the file Untouched For Years The Navy classified the patent as top secret and it remained untouched for years But after World War II the Navy was interested in developing a so called sonobuoy that would use sonar to detect submarines in the water and transmit the information to an airplane above However it needed a way to jam proof the signal between the buoy and the plane They resuscitated the idea of frequency hopping and built it into the sonobuoy And after that the whole system just spread like wildfire Rhodes says The military and private companies all started developing their own technologies around Lamarr s invention Today vestiges of her frequency hopping technique are found in most digital devices that communicate wirelessly But Rhodes says Lamarr s contribution was lost in the noise for decades In the 1990s when she was in her early 80s one of the pioneers of wireless communications for computers came across Lamarr s patent and realized she d never been honored He started the ball rolling so that one of the major communications organizations would give her one of its awards She by then had had so much bad plastic surgery that she didn t like to go out in public so she received the award by telephone he says When they called her up to tell her she would get the award her first words were Hedy Lamarr being Hedy Lamarr Well it s about time one of the biggest actresses of mgm's golden age, also lived a quiet life as an inventor. during world war ii, hedy lamarr invented a form of wireless communication that led to bluetooth, gps and more. one of the biggest actresses of mgm's golden age, also lived a quiet life as an inventor. during world war ii, hedy lamarr invented a form of wireless communication that led

Honestly I ve never looked to an iconic chocolate for inspiration That is until a day or two ago I was fortunate enough to be invited as a guest of Ellie to the launch of Ferrero s Festival of Light

Main Courses Pasta Chick Food Alert This one s for the ladies gentlemen I say that because well there s no meat in it And I know there are some of you Renaissance Men out there who are not above eating a dinner wholly devoid of animal flesh but I sure don t know any of you So for my life this dish is poised right at the top of my list of Chick Foods which means I won t make it unless Marlboro Man is in China for the week It s Pasta Primavera which translates to Spring Pasta in English and the classic dish uses a mixture of bright green vegetables mixed with pasta As I sit typing this post in 97 degree weather I m well aware that it s no longer spring And really since many of the vegetables used in my recipe don t become ripe in my garden until at least the middle of July Spring Pasta really isn t a fitting name at all Is there a Pasta Naming Coalition who can hear my complaint Is there a form I can fill out It s just that I believe calling it Pasta Primavera is really dishonest So is my suggestion that any of these vegetables came from my garden because they didn t But enough of my issues let s get on to the dish itself I ve been cooking this very recipe for twenty years Twenty years That s longer than I ve been married had children and American Idol has been on the air I remember sitting around my parents living room my senior year in high school flipping through my mom s Bon Apetit magazine as I was wont to do on the nights I was grounded which was pretty often I found a recipe for Pasta Primavera which I d never heard of before and spent the rest of the evening whipping it up for my parents It was so delicious they ungrounded me right there on the spot Then I went out and got arrested Not really as far as you know But the pasta really really was delicious and provided a wonderful basis for the version I make today Over the years I ve played with the recipe a lot and have finally reached a Pasta Primavera Nirvana a goal to which every self respecting pasta lover should aspire The key lies more in the method than the ingredients indeed using your own personal blend of favorite veggies is part of the fun of this dish I figured out that it s best to cook the vegetables in separate batches and to cook them only very slightly at first Then later when you add them to the creamy flavorful sauce you ll have a little wiggle room to adjust the thickness and seasonings without overcooking them If you cook them all together then create the sauce in the same pan the veggies will invariably overcook and become soggy and lifeless The method I ve figured out ensures a perfectly flavorful sauce and perfectly al dente vegetables which is the secret to perfect Pasta Primavera Let s go for it The Cast of Characters Zucchini Yellow Squash Onion Garlic Broccoli Carrots Mushrooms Red Bell Pepper Frozen Peas Buter Whipping Heavy Cream Half and Half and Parmesan Oh and sliced green onions if you like but I forgot to add them today Either way it s still delish Oh and a glass of dry white wine optional Start with the broccoli get a big chunk or two Then begin cutting it into smaller pieces Then cut off the stems but you ll want to leave them in the dish Now you should have a good cup to cup and a half of bite sized broccoli pieces Now take your onion And cut it in half from top to bottom Now cut off the top Peel away the outer layer Make vertical slices Then rotate it 90 degrees and slice down to dice I like to dice the onion pretty finely Now take the garlic bulb and remove three or four cloves With a heavy jar or can smash each clove And peel away the papery layer Chop the garlic finely Now peel two medium large carrots And slice them on the bias diagonal Now take two zucchini and slice them on the bias too I love zucchini There s something about it that makes me want to sculpt Now get your mushrooms I usually use white button mushrooms but I thought these baby porcinis looked interesting I love mushrooms I mean LOVE There s something about them that makes me want to play Beethoven s Ninth on a ukulele Slice em up roughly No need to be precise I also like to use yellow squash but you don t have to if they scare the living daylights out of you They used to scare me when I was nine At night I d wake up screaming if they ever entered my dreams The pile of veggies is really beginning to grow We re running out of cutting board space Now take the lovely vibrant red pepper Slice off the top Slice off the bottom and either pull or cut out the core If you re bored you could always throw this on your wrist wear it as a bangle and go paint the town red for awhile Oh and that s porcini mushroom under my fingernail not manure Now just cut the pepper in half from top to bottom and slice it into strips I don t know about you but I m tired of cutting vegetables Let s get down to the cookin Now heat 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium high skillet Now Important stuff here I believe the key to perfect Pasta Primavera is the vegetables not becoming overcooked In years past I d typically throw all the vegetables into the skillet together cook them thoroughly read too long then actually cook the sauce in the pan with the veggies which would only add to their cooking time By the end though the flavor way great the vegetables would be flaccid and lifeless And I d beat myself over the head with a tenderizing mallet So what we re going to do is cook the vegetables every so slightly in batches Start by adding the chopped onion and garlic together Cook for a minute or two until they start to turn translucent Now throw in the broccoli Stir it around And add in the carrots Stir it around and PLEASE PLEASE cook it for only a minute tops The key here is not to cook the vegetables thoroughly but just to warm them and get them coated in butter oil After you ve cooked them for a minute transfer mixture to a plate Now add in the red pepper strips Stir them around for a minute or so then transfer them to the plate Now s a good time to cook the pasta I like penne but linguini s great too Dump it in slightly salted boiling water and let s get back to the veggies The skillet s looking a little dry and lonely so why dontcha just go ahead and add a tablespoon of butter A tablespoon of butter covers a multitude of sins Now add in the zucchini and squash You definitely don t want to overcook this less than a minute is probably fine I m deathly afraid of overcooking my Pasta Primavera vegetables I ve seriously got to get a life Remove the zucchini squash and add the shrooms to the pan I add a little salt to these Don t ask me why because I rarely have a good reason for doing things Go ahead and cook the mushrooms a minute or two as you don t have to be concerned about keeping them crisp Ain t gonna happen Just look at your lovely plate of undercooked crispy definitely not overcooked veggies Now s the fun part making the creamy sauce Into the empty skillet pour 1 4 to 1 2 cup dry white wine Mmmmm there s no greater smell in the world than that stuff hitting the pan Now add about 1 2 cup low sodium chicken broth If you re averse to wine go ahead and add a whole cup of chicken broth But watch the salt later Stir in a tablespoon or so of butter Now you need to scrape the bottom of the pan I love this flat whisk Isn t it groovy Any whisk will do though Now stir around scraping the flavorful dark bits off the bottom of the pan This ll really add some character to the sauce Cook for a minute or two until liquid starts to thicken Now add 1 cup whipping heavy cream Oh live a little You can get on the Stairmaster later Now add 1 cup half and half See I could have used all cream but I wanted to be health conscious Now take 5 or 6 fresh basil leaves We need to chiffonade the basil Start by rolling the leaves into a somewhat tight ball then make thin slices Hey You just chiffonadedededed basil leaves Your life is complete Now add a nice helping about 1 2 cup grated Parmesan And stir it thoroughly Now taste the sauce and add salt to taste Also add black pepper Fresh ground is best but not mandatory for Pete s sake Really go for it with the pepper It belongs in this sauce Now add in the basil And stir it in The basil rrrrrrrrreally makes this dish so don t be bashful Now dump in all the veggies Mushrooms too And go ahead and dump in about 1 2 cup frozen peas right out of the freezer Now dump in the al dente not overcooked still has bite pasta And stirrrrrrr together Oh geez I m getting hungry Now if the sauce seems a little thick or if there doesn t seem to be enough sauce go ahead and add a good splash of chicken broth and oh what the heck How bout a little more half and half Oh and a little more Parmesan wouldn t hurt A little more salt pepper and we re talking perfection To serve it I like to dump it onto a big platter Hello gorgeous Wanna dance There should be some sauce collecting around the edges I like to throw some more chiffonade of basil all over the top because I m a middle child Here s a close up look at the freaky delicious ridiculous sauce Now go forth and make this Pasta Primavera Your sensory receptors will never be the same And if any of you men try it I want to hear from you I need to believe Prep Time 30 Minutes Cook Time 20 Minutes Difficulty Easy Servings 4 Ingredients 1 cup Bite sized Broccoli

you don t come back here and tell me I didn t Not only does this smell good but it s just a cool bread it pulls apart very easily and it looks cool Do I need to say more Just a few yeast notes because I have had comments before where folks can t get their bread to rise with yeast Few things to think about with yeast especially if you are using dry yeast Make sure your yeast is not old or expired Old yeast either will not rise or takes much longer to rise Secondly make sure your warm ingredients are lukewarm not cold and not too hot Think warm milk to your baby Then let it rise in a warm place I usually put it on my stove and have the light on Cinnamon Sugar Pull Apart Bread Adapted from Joy The Baker Yields one 9x5x3 inch loaf Prep Time 2 hours Bake Time 35 minutes For the Dough 2 3 4 cups plus 2 tbsp all purpose flour1 4 cup granulated sugar2 1 4 tsp 1 envelope active dry yeast1 2 tsp salt2 oz unsalted butter1 3 cup whole milk1 4 cup water2 large eggs at room temperature1 tsp pure vanilla extract For the Filling 1 cup granulated sugar2 tsp ground cinnamon1 2 tsp fresh ground nutmeg2 oz unsalted butter melted until browned In a large mixing bowl whisk together 2 cups flour sugar yeast and salt Set aside Whisk together eggs and set aside In a small saucepan melt together milk and butter until butter has just melted Remove from the heat and add water and vanilla extract Let mixture stand for a minute or two or until the mixture registers 115 to 125 degrees F Pour the milk mixture into the dry ingredients and mix with a spatula Add the eggs and stir the mixture until the eggs are incorporated into the batter The eggs will feel soupy and it ll seem like the dough and the eggs are never going to come together Keep stirring Add the remaining 3 4 cup of flour and stir with the spatula for about 2 minutes The mixture will be sticky That s just right Place the dough is a large greased bowl Cover with a clean kitchen towel Place in a warm space and allow to rest until doubled in size about 1 hour Note The dough can be risen until doubled in size then refrigerated overnight for use in the morning If you re using this method just let the dough rest on the counter for 30 minutes before following the roll out directions below While the dough rises whisk together the sugar cinnamon and nutmeg for the filling Set aside Melt 2 ounces of butter until browned Set aside Grease and flour a 9x5x3 inch loaf pan Set that aside too Deflate the risen dough and knead about 2 tablespoons of flour into the dough Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rest for 5 minutes On a lightly floured work surface use a rolling pin to roll the dough out The dough should be 12 inches tall and about 20 inches long Use a pastry brush to spread melted butter across all of the dough Sprinkle with all of the sugar and cinnamon mixture It might seem like a lot of sugar But just go for it Slice the dough vertically into six equal sized strips Stack the strips on top of one another and slice the stack into six equal slices once again You ll have six stacks of six squares Layer the dough squares in the loaf pan like a flip book Place a kitchen towel over the loaf pan and allow in a warm place for 30 to 45 minutes or until almost doubled in size Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F Place loaf in the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes until the top is very golden brown The top may be lightly browned but the center may still be raw A nice dark golden brown will ensure that the center is cooked as well Remove from the oven and allow to rest for 20 to 30 minutes Run a butter knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the bread and invert onto a clean board Place a cake stand or cake plate on top of the upside down loaf and carefully invert so it s right side up Serve warm with coffee or tea This bread is best served the day it s made but it can also we wrapped and kept at room temperature for up to 2 days Next week is my birthday and to

beverages the problem is most of these same people don t realize the volume of calories they are putting in their bodies when they consume these products Even freshly squeezed juices are very calorie dense If you are pounding back any of these drinks on a regular basis cutting them out could do wonders for your waste line without even adding in any exercise This list will be from the least calorie dense drinks all the way up to the super calorie dense options And since I am such a nice guy I m even going to suggest a few low calorie alternatives to help give you something to sip on over the day 8 7 11 Cola SlurpeeThis one seems almost obvious although I was shocked to see it this low on the list when compared to some of the other popular drinks Slurpee Nutritional InfoOz 24 Calories 210Fat 0gCarbs 53 9gProtein Sugar 53 9gCalories Per oz 8 75Alternatives to SlurpeesWhile I personally love a Slurpee on a hot summers day one alternative is a home made calorie free Slurpee Take your blender mix in roughly 1 2 cup of pre made crystal light and then add roughly half a tray of ice cubes more if you want it slushier Blend the concoction up for a calorie free Slurpee 7 Pepsi Cola Coca Cola Another obvious one near the top of the list is sugar packed sodas such as Coke or Pepsi Your average 12oz serving has roughly 150 calories If you drink three cans a day that s 160200 calories a year which is roughly 45 lbs of PURE FAT Pepsi Nutritional Info Oz 12Calories 150Fat 0gCarbs 42gProtein Sugar 42gCalories Per oz 12 50Alternatives to Pepsi Coke SodasThis is actually a really easy fix if you are willing to make a bit of a change Switch from Pepsi to Diet Pepsi The taste might not be that pleasing at first but after a few weeks you don t even notice the aftertaste any more I personally actually prefer diet sodas over regular these days If you drink diet soda you are 100 reducing these drink calories from your diet 6 Fresh Orange JuiceYes you are reading this correctly Juices are jam packed full of calories whether you are drinking apple juice orange juice or grape juice they all contain a ton of sugar and a ton of unnecessary calories If you really just want some vitamin C take a supplement or eat an actual orange and get some of the fiber to go along with it Fresh Orange Juice Nutrition InfoOz 12Calories 170Fat 0 8gCarbs 39 2gProtein 2 6Sugar 31 7gCalories Per oz 14 17Fresh Juice Alternatives If you are drinking juice for Vitamins eat the fruit and get some of the benefits of the fiber If you are just looking for something that has some flavor mix up some Crystal Light and enjoy a tasty calorie free drink 5 GatoradeIf Gatorade is good for athletes it has got to be good for me right WRONG Gatorade was developed to help athletes quickly replenish depleted energy sources and as a result is jam packed full of sugar as well as calories Unless you are performing at a very high level athletically drinking Gatorade is only going to build your spare tire around your waste Gatorade Nutrition Info Oz 12Calories 170Fat 0 8gCarbs 39 2gProtein 2 6Sugar 31 7gCalories Per oz 25 83Gatorade Alternatives If you really want to drink a sports drink pickup one of Gatorade s new G2 sports drinks It is a low calorie alternative and won t turn you into an overweight wannabe athlete 4 Starbucks Mint Chocolaty Chip Frappuccino blended creme with Chocolate Whipped Cream Let s face it you shouldn t be drinking Starbucks Frappuccino s if you are trying to watch your waste line They are so packed full of calories you could easily gain a pound a week by drinking a Venti every day One Frapp stands out in the crowd for being the ultimate weight gainer and that is the Mint Chocolaty Chip Frappuccino blended cr\u00e8me with Chocolate Whipped Cream try saying that 5 times This drink is a behemoth with 680 calories in a single 24oz serving That is an astounding 28 33 calories per oz If you are planning on dressing up as Santa Clause this winter and don t want to stuff your pants with pillows this is definitely the daily beverage for you Starbucks Mint Chocolaty Chip Frappuccino blended creme with Chocolate Whipped Cream Nutrition InfoOz 24Calories 680Fat 21gCarbs 115gProtein 18Sugar 93gCalories Per oz 28 33Frappuccino Alternatives If you are really feeling the urge to get a blended Frapp from Starbucks first step is to look at the light section The next step is to select the Espresso Frappuccino Light Blended Coffee A Venti 24oz serving still has 150 calories but that is substantially better than its Mint Chocolaty companion For those who care the Espresso Frappuccino Light Blended Coffee packs 6 25 calories per oz 3 7 11 French Vanilla Caf\u00e9 Cooler7 11 got a little upset when Starbucks started stealing their grown up Slurpee customers who wanted blended coffee So what did they do They came up with Coffee Slurpees to stir up the competition Unlucky for us though these Slurpees come packed with nearly four times the calories of a traditional Slurpee Check out the nutritional information on these tasty morsels 7 11 French Vanilla Caf\u00e9 Cooler Nutrition Info Oz 20 Calories 634Fat 27gCarbs 97gProtein 1 6Sugar 97gCalories Per oz 31 70French Vanilla Caf\u00e9 Alternatives Honestly if you have to buy something from 7 11 to replace your French Vanilla Caf\u00e9 Cooler I would recommend grabbing a cup of coffee toss a bit of skim milk and some sugar free Vanilla syrup in it Run over to the Big Gulp machine and toss a few ice cubes in your cup to cool it down and make a chilled beverage Aside from that any of the caf\u00e9 coolers are pretty much going to turn you into a fat air balloon 2 McDonald s Chocolate Triple Thick ShakeLeave it to McDonalds to have the second most fattening drink that I have ever seen If you ve ever tasted their Chocolate Triple Thick Shake you would know instantly that there is no way something with so much creamy tasty flavor could ever be good for you This calorie behemoth could help you pack on as much as two pounds of fat a week when combined with your normal diet Pretty impressive huh Chocolate Triple Thick Shake Nutrition Info Oz 32 Calories 1160Fat 27gCarbs 203gProtein 27Sugar 168gCalories Per oz 36 25Chocolate Triple Thick Shake Alternatives If you really want to drink a Chocolate milk shake you are looking at a calorie dense beverage no matter what way you shake it If you want to make something that is at least somewhat healthy for you blend 1 2 cup skim milk with 2 scoops chocolate whey protein and half a tray of ice It will taste like a chocolate milk shake with way less sugar but you still can t avoid the calories 1 Bubble Tea with Milk and Tapioca PearlsBubble Tea is an Asian drink that has many variations these days The original Bubble Tea came from Taiwan and was a combination of Black tea condensed milk honey and pearls tapioca balls These days the black tea and condensed milk can be substituted with fruity teas or milky fruit teas all of which are jam packed with gut producing calories A standard Bubble Tea with milk and pearls contains roughly 510 calories in just a 12 oz serving If you just broke out your calculator you would now know that Bubble tea can contain 42 50 calories per oz What does that mean for you It means that Bubble Tea is a one way ticket to Obesity Boulevard Bubble Tea with Milk and Tapioca Pearls Nutritional Info Oz 12 Calories 510Fat 20 4gCarbs 79 05gProtein 6Sugar gCalories Per oz 42 50Bubble Tea Alternatives Alright this one you are going to have to suck up and just stop drinking There is absolutely no reason why

distracted cranky mentally sick and drained of energy They suffer from their inability to focus and generate interesting ideas a lack of inspiration and inability to perform daily activities at an optimal level etc Sometimes we feel absolutely emptied out and worn out and in many of us this condition has turned into a chronic one What to do How to prevent it First of all let s look at the reasons and the habits that drain our energy all the time Habit One A constant lack of sleep and proper rest No one should underestimate the importance of regular restful sleep but unfortunately up to 65 of today s population suffer from regular lack of sleep We can t get enough of sleep during the weekdays and as a result we are trying to compensate it during the weekend this way damaging our inner clock and causing various imbalances in the body As a result we start feeling worn out cranky distressed and like a boiled rag Habit Two Internet addiction This is a really bad habit which causes many negative consequences Excessive internet communication like checking out email massages sending instant messages and checking out voicemail social networking etc takes a lot of time and energy distracts our attention makes us tired of multitasking and does not allow us to do enough of exercise Control your daily activities in the office and do not allow internet addiction swallow you completely Habit Three Healthy eating addiction Due to massive campaigns in modern mass media supporting various types of diets and diet plans many people especially young ladies tend to drain themselves out with diets and not eating anything They feel sad and dejected for their being unable to put off weight so they occasionally give up eating completely and suffer from chronic hunger This everything is really exhausting and those women who want to be always successful attractive and energetic should avoid such experiments like not eating all the time Habit Four Overeating This is an antipode of habit three Some people are convinced that the more they eat the more energetic and active they are going to be They do not mind consuming large meals filled with sugars and carbohydrates which have destructive effects on their digestive and cardio vascular systems In addition overeating always slows down the function of all body systems and evokes a feeling of sleepiness To be on top energy levels it is recommended to eat small portions every 3 4 hours Habit Five Caffeine addiction Many of us start our day with a cup of coffee but not all of us know that the effects of drinking 4 5 cups of coffee a day are directly opposed to the effects of drinking 1 2 cups The more coffee you drink the less energy you have for your daily activities because coffee stimulates dehydration and makes your body tired of reducing the effects of excessive caffeine Control your daily consumption of coffee and caffeinated drinks and try to dink more water Habit Six Chronic pains This factor is among the most exhausting and killing ones which drains our energy a lot Chronic pains can be caused by various types of sicknesses ailments and injuries These pains are prolonged and sometimes persistent and they require a lot of patience and willpower to cope with Very often they cause insomnia depression a lack of appetite self confidence and physical activities inability to focus and so on Certainly this everything affects our life quality to a great extent Therefore chronic pains should be properly treated in order to reduce their energy draining effects Habit Seven A lack of fresh air This factor can cause excessive toxins in your body allergies slowed down thyroid function stresses and dropped down energy levels Find some time to go out especially when you get tired or feel lack of energy Habit Eight A lack of sunlight If your work is connected with lots of thinking generating various ideas and making various decisions it can be essential to expose yourself to good amounts of sunlight which stimulates brainwork and helps to focus When you wake up in the morning enjoy the first sunrays which can give signals to your brain about the beginning of a new day This is a very effective way to reduce energy draining effects since the early morning Habit Nine Unsolved emotional problems Hate or anger pity or sadness all sorts of emotional burden affect our mental condition and drain our energy It is highly important not to avoid resolving your emotional issues otherwise your chances to live your life in depressions exhaustion and emotional imbalances are very high Author Info Hi My name is Carla and I am a 5th year medical student at HYMS I am interested in alternative medicine and I have done months researching the topic of herbal medicine Besides I like

Body Balanced Lifestyle Balanced Mind and Soul Balanced Nutrition March 9 2010 13 Comments This post was written by Anastasiya Follow me on Twitter or StumbleUpon and keep your life balanced When you hear the word heart what do you think about Do you think about a heart attack or do you think about love do you think about health or do you think about kindness and generosity Maybe some of you will think about Ann and Nancy Wilson and will get the song Barracuda stuck in your heads but this is not the heart I am talking about I am not sure if you ve heard about it or not but February was heart awareness month I know that February is long gone I might be a little behind but I do have a calendar on my desktop but our heart is with us every day and every second of our lives Do we really need to be aware of it just one month a year A healthy and strong heart is what lets us enjoy our life it lets us be healthy and happy it lets us be open to new experiences and love Our heart is what makes us alive in a physical and spiritual sense Your heart is the ultimate indicator of how much balance you have in your life because your lifestyle has the biggest impact on your ticker I want to challenge you to take care of your heart today and every day from now on There are hundreds of things that you can do that will ensure that your heart stays young in both senses all your life A merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spirit drieth the bones Proverbs 17 22 Taking care of your heart only physically is not enough A recent study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine showed that keeping your weight under control having your BMI under 30 being active and not smoking reduced risks of dying prematurely of any chronic disease including cardiovascular disease by 80 Can you think of any pill that can do the same But these changes will not be enough if you forget about the other side of your heart That side is rejuvenated through kindness love affection friendship and faith Let me show you 77 7 ways how you can keep your heart healthy and open to the world every day of your life Nutrition Keep your plate bright The more colorful your diet is the more phytonutrients you are getting that can ward off heart disease obesity and cancer Be sweet savvy A diet high in sugars just two or three sweetened drinks are already too much leads to high blood pressure Cut down on any refined sugars and especially high fructose corn syrup Use natural sweeteners If you still want to satisfy your sweet cravings opt for natural sweeteners like fruit honey and organic maple syrup because these sweet treats combine sugar fructose with vitamins and fiber that are so important for a healthy heart Do not go overboard though everything is good in moderation Follow the 80 20 rule It is great to eat healthy all the time but it is virtually impossible Leave a 20 room for any unhealthy cravings fast food on a road trip or a big party with chips and creamy dips Cut back on saturated fats No matter what your age and risk factors are it will help you to lower your LDL cholesterol bad cholesterol and live a longer life Limit saturated fat to 7 of your daily calories 10 to 11 grams Reduce your sodium intake Sodium increases your risks of hypertension that makes your heart work harder and wear out faster Table salt is usually not your biggest enemy because most of the sodium in our diets come from fast foods and processed foods Eat a clean diet Clean diet is the one that is low in processed foods and that uses as many natural products as possible Some of the examples are eating an orange instead of drinking orange juice fixing your own chicken for sandwiches instead of using deli meats choosing whole wheat bread and pasta instead of white varieties Be full of beans One third of a cup of cooked beans daily can lower your chances of having a heart attack by 38 Cut back on breakfast cereals While there are some healthy options most cereals are far from being a healthy start of the day Too much sugar no vitamins or fiber high levels of sodium and even trans fats turn this traditional breakfast food into a disaster for your heart Before you buy your next box take your time to read the label and choose the most natural and healthy cereal Sip some tea The antioxidants in green and black tea improve blood vessel function and increase blood flow Drink your tea without sugar eat a few dried apricots or add some honey to give it a sweet note and choose organic loose tea that has not been stripped of all healthy nutrients Go bananas Bananas are the most heart healthy fruits because they have high levels of potassium Dried apricots and prunes are also excellent sources of this mineral Have a baked potato Spuds are a top source of potassium a mineral that can offset the effects of sodium Drink your veggies You can get an extra serving of vegetables by drinking a low sodium vegetable juice It is even better to make your own juice at home and drink it for breakfast do not forget to add some apples and carrots to make this juice drinkable Go Italian Italian cuisine uses tomatoes and tomato sauce abundantly and it is your best bet to lower your risks of heart attack or stroke by 65 Spaghetti with Marinara sauce vegetarian lasagna and pizza with half the cheese and double the sauce are excellent ideas for any heart healthy meals Eat salmon and sardines for lunch These varieties of fish are great sources of omega 3 fatty acids that protect you against inflammation and lower triglycerides Have a salmon sandwich instead of tuna or mix sardines with spicy mustard and red onions and serve them with bread or crackers Spice up your meals Onions and garlic might not be your best choice if you are going on a romantic date or an important interview but they can remove excess LDL cholesterol from your body Onions and garlic also will give a nice flavor to any dish without adding extra salt or fat Get hot Hot peppers and hot sauce of course contain a chemical called capsaicin that protects your heart and arteries from any possible problems You can read more here Start your day with oatmeal It won t only give you enough energy to survive the most demanding day it will also lower your cholesterol and general risks of heart disease Top it with blueberries bananas or walnuts or sprinkle some cinnamon to make it deliciously healthy Be smart when eating out Just because you are going out does not mean that you should forget about heart healthy meals Most restaurants can cook healthy meals in a way that you have never tried them before your taste buds won t even notice the difference Share portions or take half of the portion home avoid appetizers and bread with butter ask your waiter for sauces and gravies on the side do not order fried breaded or tempura dishes Ask your waiter how your meal is prepared and what ingredients are used Satisfy your eyes not only your mouth Moderate eating is the best strategy to keep your weight under control weight is one of the decisive factors when it comes to heart disease If you make your meal look pleasing to the eye you will get satisfied faster without consuming extra calories One of the reasons why every meal at a restaurant tastes so good is because chefs take time to organize every plate in the most eye pleasing way Cut down on coffee consumption There are studies that suggest that coffee is beneficial to your heart in the long run but moderation is the key in this case One medium Starbucks has the daily allowed amount of caffeine so do not go overboard One cup of coffee a day is a safe way to benefit your heart help you wake up and satisfy your cravings Go nuts Nuts can help you lower your LDL bad cholesterol while providing your body with essential fatty acids fiber and protein Walnuts are considered the best nuts because they have the highest amount of omega 3s but other nuts almonds pecans pistachios hazelnuts are good too Eat about a handful a day as a snack or mix them into the salad or main dish Remember that you can cancel out the health benefits of nuts if they are covered with salt chocolate or sugar Order curry at a restaurant or cook it yourself The spice that gives curry its vibrant yellow color is turmeric This spice has been used in Asian medicine for a long time and recent research suggests that curcumin a natural ingredient in turmeric and ginger can dramatically decrease the chances of developing heart failure reverse and prevent cardiac hypertrophy This spice also has a dozen other health benefits that will improve your health and mood at the same time Turmeric tastes great if you add it to chicken beans rice beef and vegetables Experiment in the chicken or make a reservation at an Indian restaurant Have dark chocolate for dessert Dark chocolate 70 cacao content or higher has shown to lower blood pressure Eat a few squares for a desert or drink some dark cocoa avoid sugar as much as possible to take care of your heart and taste buds Drink red wine in moderation Red wine is considered one of the reasons Mediterranean diet is so healthy for your heart Low amounts of alcohol together with antioxidants prevent heart disease by increasing levels of good cholesterol and protecting against artery damage Cut back on eating out and take outs We all know that restaurant portions are oversized but most dishes are also high in sodium or fat eating out a couple of times a month won t harm you but making it a weekly practice can harm your heart waste line and wallet all at the same time Be smart Eat mindfully Mindful eating is when you eat only when you are hungry not stressed or bored when you pay attention to the way your food tastes and when you take your time savoring every bite as opposed to shoveling it down on the run If you eat mindfully you will be able to lose unnecessary weight and prevent the scale from creeping up Read food labels Avoid foods with any partially hydrogenated oils saturated fat and especially trans fats because they are deadly for your body and heart Snack on dried fruit Dried fruit have the same health benefits as regular ones but in concentrated form They are rich in fiber essential for lowering cholesterol vitamins and potassium I love munching on dried dates apricots or prunes They are a healthy way for me to satisfy my sweet tooth and take care of my heart at the same time Exercise Be active all day If you are active in little ways throughout the day gardening cleaning the house running errands then your heart will be healthier than the one of a person who exercises for 30 60 minutes and then sits at the computer all day long Interval training It is the best type of exercise for prevention of heart disease and diabetes Follow a 3 1 ratio while exercising 3 minutes of moderately paced activities followed by 1 minute of high intensity activities You can try it while walking and running or you can combine different types of exercise like lunges and jumps Just 20 minutes of interval training is as effective for your heart as the whole hour of moderate exercise Be flexible A recent study in Japan has found that people who were limber after 40 has 30 less stiffness in the arteries Stretch for 10 15 minutes every day to keep your arteries pliable Try Yoga Yoga does not provide any cardiovascular benefits as any aerobic activity does but it lowers your levels of stress and keeps your arteries elastic Yoga also soothes your nervous system which lowers blood pressure and makes heart rates steady Add resistance bands to your home gym This inexpensive prop can spruce up any boring workout and help you build muscle mass that reduces your body fat and raises levels of good cholesterol HDL Follow these guidelines The American Heart Association recommends that you get 30 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity on 5 days of the week or 20 minutes of vigorous intensity exercise on 3 days each week Strength training is recommended at least 2 times every week Do enjoyable exercise It is important for your body to move and for your heart to get a workout but it is also important to enjoy what you are doing If you love your type of exercise then you are more likely to stick with for many healthy years You will experience body and mind benefits if you choose wisely Lifestyle Cuddle up with a fur ball A recent study published in USA Today shows that cat owners cut their risks of heart attack by almost a third Scientists suggest that dogs provide similar benefits because both help to relieve stress of their owners Quit smoking This one does not need explanation if you want to have a healthy life Keep your BMI under 30 preferably around 18 5 25 BMI is a body mass index that can be easily calculated using this formula BMI weight in pounds 703 height in inches 2Mine is 18 8 What is yours Get busy under sheets Men and women who have sex at least 2 3 times a week decrease their risks of heart disease by 50 study published in the American Journal of Cardiology Isn t it a good enough reason to have a romantic night out today and every day Take a vitamin D supplement Vitamin D the one that is important for your bone strength also plays a very important role in protecting you from heart disease Vitamin D deficiency doubles the risks of dying from a heart disease by 50 according to the Framingham Heart Study Ask your physician to test your blood for vitamin D and take a supplement if needed Go out in the sunshine Vitamin D as stated in the previous tip is essential for the heart health Before you start taking any supplements spend 10 15 minutes in the noon sun on most days of the week Do not use any sunscreen during this sunshine exposure because sunscreen blocks UV B light bands that produce vitamin D in our bodies Wear a hat and cover your face but let as many parts of your body as possible be exposed to the sun Get enough sleep Anxiety bad mood and irritability are not the only consequences of not getting enough sleep Skimping on sleep can promote calcium buildup in the arteries which can lead to a heart attack causing plaque Listen to joyful and calming music Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore have shown for the first time that the emotions aroused by joyful music have a healthy effect on blood vessel function Music provides the same effects as laughter so tune into your favorite melody as often as possible Have a few green plants in your house Seeing green increases happiness and creativity and decreases stress levels according to a study from Washington State University Plants also clean the air in your house or office from pollutants like chemicals and dust that can trigger rapid spikes in blood pressure Stress Management Socialize Going out with your friends can be as heart healthy as hitting the gym Lonely people who do not communicate with their friends a lot had 10 30 points higher blood pressure than their more sociable peers Detach from stuff We surround ourselves with tons of things that make our life easier that bring certain pleasures into our lives and that look nice or help us kill time when we are bored Practice detachment from all this stuff and you will find your heart to be much more open to everything around you Have a plan for a stressful situation We cannot avoid all stressful situations in our life but we can prepare for them Make it a rule to think of one positive thing in your life whenever stressful thoughts start creeping into your head or carry a list of things that you are grateful for Another idea is to have a few pictures of the happiest moments of your life or people who always bring happiness in your life with you Take a tech break Being plugged in all the time puts you on the edge and increases the production of stress hormones that cause your blood pressure to rise Turn off your cell phone in the evening do not check your email and log off any IM system Have this time to yourself not somebody else Meditate Meditation calms your mind and your heart at the same time Practice it daily or at least 3 times a week Get organized Why is it relevant to your heart Cluttered environments suppress your productivity and increase your stress levels which affect the health of your heart Stop being a perfectionist Perfectionism will cause a lot of unnecessary stress in your life that will eventually damage your heart When you feel that you are striving for the perfect whatever repeat to yourself Good is good enough Enjoy your time in silence and solitude Make it a habit to spend some time alone weekly to let your mind float away your stress dissolve in the air and your heart open to the miracles of the world Slow down in life Fast paced life leads to depression and stress it undermines your ability to enjoy time with your family or doing things you love All these factors are important for a healthy and open heart Have a me break Giving working helping taking care of others are all honorable missions but you need some time for yourself Do not consider it pampering or selfishness This is your chance to get reacquainted with yourself and to have some rest from the world around you no matter how wonderful it might be Let yourself relax Being in the always ready condition is very stressful Let somebody else take care of the kids order a take out not more than twice a month remember take a day off at work and let yourself completely relax Your heart will enjoy this break from your busy lifestyle Happiness and Kindness Surround yourself with positive people Negative friends can drain you and increase your levels of stress Try to hang out only with positive people and you will notice how your own levels of optimism will shift Be happy According to a recent study in Nova Scotia Canada happiness and general positivity protects heart from any degenerative disease Laugh Just 15 minutes of laughter daily can boost your blood flow by 22 percent and prevent your arteries from hardening Call a funny friend or watch a comedy every day Speak up Bottling up your feelings won t do your heart or your relationships any favor If something is bothering you bring it up and resolve the issue once and for all Do something enjoyable In order to up your happiness levels spend 15 20 minutes a day doing something that you like Do not abandon it if your schedule gets too busy Practice random acts of kindness While you are taking care of your physical heart do not forget that you are more complex than a machine Kind heart is as important as low cholesterol for your health Be kind for no apparent reason and find deepest joy in this kindness Savor joyful events If something amazing happens in your life remember this event and go over it when you are feeling down Practice forgiveness Holding a grudge will harden your heart and close it to the entire world Forgive people and move on with your life Visualize your best self If you are not satisfied with yourself then think of what would make you completely happy with yourself Visualize this picture every day and start taking small steps to reach this goal Be generous Generosity boosts happiness on an everyday basis Start small by giving smiles to everybody around you and give as much as your heart wants to Be positive Both optimists and pessimists have bad days but optimists get over those days quickly while pessimists savor their sufferings and complain about their lives constantly No matter what the day brings you choose to be positive and concentrate on good things around you Express your heart s desires Our creativity is born in our heart and if we suppress any spark of it then we also block our hearts from happiness Express whatever is born in your heart to keep your heart young and open for life Show some self love Take care of your needs as much as you take care of others Even though being generous is a key to keeping your heart young you must still learn to be generous to yourself Do not be a martyr because the times when it was appreciated are long gone Say a prayer Open your heart to God and he will take care of you Say a prayer from your heart and you will feel that any of your burdens have been lifted and your heart will be touched by Him Practice gratitude Be grateful for what you have and for what will come be grateful even for what you do not have because chances are that you are better off without it Try something new Keep your heart open to new experiences by trying something new as often as possible This practice will keep your heart agile and young for many years and when you are 60 70 or 100 you will not consider yourself an old wreck You will be a person who has lived and is still living his her life with a young heart Follow your passion Following your passion will help you live a more fulfilling life it will help you fight stress in life and be happy in general If you can earn living by following your passion then it is great go for it But if not just devote some time in your busy schedule to do what you are passionate about whether it is writing cooking or just playing with your kids Help somebody Helping people around you whether these are people you know or complete strangers is the best way to keep your heart open kind and young According to the research Peggy Thoits Professor of Sociology at Vanderbilt University volunteering increased happiness life satisfaction self esteem sense of control over life physical health and decreased depression It is healthy to be good Kiss hug touch Little things like holding hands hugging kissing lovingly and cuddling are the signs of a strong couple Strong couples have better emotional and intellectual connections they have better and more frequent sex and they have less amounts of stress which leads to heart disease This is a no brainer if you want to take care of your heart take care of your relationship and treasure the connection physical and mental that you have By the way non sexual hugs and touches with friends or family members have proved to increase happiness and even lower blood pressure hold a hug for at least 6 seconds Be patient Patience brings many benefits but the most heart healthy one is less stress in your life You do not have to get mad when you sit in a traffic jam or waste your time standing in a line Distract yourself with pleasant thoughts about your family plan your supper ahead of time or think about ideas for a new business Find your virtues A strong heart is a virtuous heart because this heart knows how to do the right thing for the right reason 7 Do not let your heart go numb When you feel that you avoid new experiences new emotions new adventures because you are scared of pain and disappointment know that you are intentionally blocking your heart You are suffocating it by not letting it live and breathe fully Do not be scared open up and embrace life instead of hiding from it Share experience with your loved ones Our society has become too materialistic Our expression of love or apology usually has a price tag on it Money can buy you a comfortable life but it can t buy you happiness Spend quality time with the people you care about and enjoy every moment together See miracles around you Our life is full of miracles that we often do not notice Train yourself to see those miracles around you a birth of a child or wonderful butterfly in your yard are both miracles and you will notice that your life will get more positive Find the meaning of your life Meaningless life leads to an empty heart and an empty heart has no way of staying healthy and young Live a meaningful life that fills your heart Be childlike not childish Children are honest joyful full of energy open to the world full of love for the entire world not scared of anything and absolutely adorable Play with them spend as much time with them as possible and learn from them This is the best way to maintain your youthfulness inside and out Enjoy your life Focus on enjoying every moment of your life and making every moment count What is the point of living a life even with a healthy heart if this life is empty and boring Do things try things be brave lose your fears love be passionate and stay positive Make decisions that you will be proud of and avoid mistakes that you will regret Make it all count Be in love Love opens our hearts and makes us bloom all year round Cherish the love that you have and try to stay in love until the last day of your life Love and magic have a great deal in common They enrich the soul delight the heart And they both take practice Nora Roberts I am not asking you to read

"",""body"":""The giveaway is now closed but I hope you still enjoy the Nutella Stuffed Cookies After making the first batch of Chocolate Nutella Fudge with Sea Salt last year my family kids grandparents and brother in law included immediately determined it was a must have for each Christmas to be served alongside my husband s great grandmother s spritz butter cookies and my dad s killer ginger cookies Yeah okay twist my arm That fudge set off a cascade of gooey chocolate and hazelnut baking in our house from Chewy Nutella Oatmeal Bars to Nutella Cream Cheese Swirled Blondies It was only a matter of time before the Nutella weaseled its way into the center of my favorite sugar cookie recipe typically made with crumbled Heath Bars When making drop cookies I like to be fairly precise about the size of each cookie so that they cook as evenly as possible No loosey goosey dropping from a spoon in this elf s kitchen For years I have used cookie scoops such as the OXO ones you see in the photos below to dole out an equal amount of batter It makes the process of doling out the dough go quickly and the scoops are fun for little hands to use too You can use the small scoops for bite sized cookies medium scoops for your average sized treats and large scoops for those gargantuan cookies like what you may see in your favorite bakery Of course if you decide to make bite sized cookies that means you get to eat a minimum of three cookies Santa s rule I swear on Rudolph s shiny red nose It s a good thing this rule exists because it is virtually impossible to eat only one of these cookies For details on entering the OXO baking giveaway scroll down You don t want to miss it Again on Rudolph s shiny red nose The recipe Using a 1 teaspoon measure scoop out Nutella and place in small mounds on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper Place in the freezer for 15 minutes Place an oven rack in the middle position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper In a medium bowl whisk together flour baking powder and salt In a large bowl beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer set on medium speed until the mixture is creamy and fluffy 3 to 5 minutes Beat in eggs one at a time and vanilla extract Turn the mixer to low speed and gradually beat in the flour mixture until it is just combined Using a rubber spatula stir the mixture a few times to make sure all of the flour mixture is incorporated Place 1 3 cup granulated sugar in a small bowl Use 2 tablespoons cookie dough for each cookie Split the piece of dough in half and slightly flatten the bottom half Sprinkle 5 or 6 grains of sea salt on the dough Use a small metal spatula to lift the mounds of Nutella from the baking sheet and lay on the bottom half of cookie dough on top of the salt If the Nutella starts to soften place back in the freezer for a few minutes Cover with the other piece of cookie dough Seal the edges with your fingers Roll the ball in the sugar to coat it and place it on a prepared baking sheet Bake the cookies one sheet a time rotating from front to back halfway through baking They are done when the edges are set and beginning to brown 10 to 13 minutes The centers of the cookies should still be soft and puffy Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes Using a spatula

line - loneplacebo loneplacebo how to download youtube videos via the command line"",""body"":""I don t purport this tutorial as being the ideal way to download Youtube videos to your computer A simple Google search will lead you to an assortment of options that requires less technical expertise However if you re like me and are relatively new to the command line think your OS without the GUI and a mouse this might be an interesting way to accomplish something relatively useful download Youtube videos to your computer and also learn how to directly communicate with your computer In this tutorial I ll be using a command line program called youtube dl Sorry Window users This walkthrough is tailored for Mac Linux users However there is a nice write up here which you can follow as well Working with Terminal The Basics I m no command line genius maybe just a hair above a beginner I know how to navigate my way through the system directory output files folders copy delete stuff and open applications Thankfully that should be enough for completing this guide First download and save the youtube dl program to your computer here You should right click the link and select Save Link As and save the file with the Python extension py Next open up Terminal on your Mac Type in cd usr local NOTE This is a hidden directory on your computer system where some of the core programs are being handled Thus I urge extra caution when working here I also like to use the ls command which outputs a list of all the files and directories I can navigate to next based on my current location Go ahead and try it now Next type into Terminal open bin Click to enlarge A new Finder window should appear containing a bunch of cryptic looking files The reason why we have to navigate to this folder via Terminal is because by default it is a hidden system folder meaning it can t be reached via Finder alone There is a Terminal command to display all hidden files by default but it is generally advised not to do so Press Authenticate and enter your login credentials Paste your youtube dl py file now in the bin folder you are in A pop up will appear telling you that you don t have permission to do so Select Authenticate and enter your login password Verify that the file was correctly saved to the directory Currently in Terminal we are sitting inside the usr local directory Next type in cd bin This moves you into the bin folder where you had saved the youtube dl py file to in the previous step A short intro to file permissions File permissions determine which users can perform a certain action on specific files and directories There are read r write w and execute x permissions and are assigned to three types of users a user u b group g and c other o Read the following articles for a more further details The reason why I mention file permissions is because you will need to edit the file permissions for the youtube dl py file currently residing in your bin folder At the moment the file only has read and write access to the user which is you You can view the permissions using the ls command mentioned earlier by including the l option which displays extra details So typing in the following ls l while in the bin directory should display something like this rwxrwxr x 1 tonyhue staff 66816 Jan 10 2011 twdiff rwxrwxr x 1 tonyhue staff 77120 Jan 10 2011 twfind rw r xr x 1 tonyhue staff 139584 Oct 20 18 33 youtube dl py There should be other files but I only included the last three which includes the youtube dl py file You can also check the permissions for a specific file directory by using the g option ls lg youtube dl py In order for the program to run you need to give yourself execution permission Currently youtube dl py has read and write access To add execution permission we will use the chmod command by typing in chmod u x youtube dl py Verify that the correct permissions for the file contain read write and execution permission by typing in ls lg youtube dl py Almost there Congrats You ve hopefully made it this far unscathed After modifying the permissions for the youtube dl py file you can now start downloading Youtube videos to your computer from the command line Just type in youtube dl py youtube video link Don t include the bracket parenthesis Things should be working properly if Terminal outputs something that looks like this youtube w639H9ZUqZw Downloading video webpage youtube w639H9ZUqZw Downloading video info webpage youtube w639H9ZUqZw Extracting video information download Destination w639H9ZUqZw mp4 download 100 0 of 9 53M at 9 06M s ETA 00 00 Don t fret if you start getting error messages Try restarting Terminal and attempting again Verify that youtube dl py has rwx permissions Also check to see if you remembered to include the py extension If all has gone according to plan you should be able to find your newly downloaded video in your Users folder Yeah I know Terrible place to put it amiright What else Pat yourself on the back once more You ve successfully downloaded a Youtube video to your computer Youtube dl has a number of available options to customize the video you download such as changing the video filename to the video s title instead of its id Also the program can also download videos from other sources besides Youtube including Vimeo Daily Motion and Metacafe The sky is the limit majoring in technology downloading videos off youtube is such a common ritual on the internet, but how about doing it via the command line? command line, terminal, youtube videos, download youtube
